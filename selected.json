It has been implemented into domestic legislation, pursuant to the Private International Law Act.  Ms Wheeler submits that the intention underlying the 1996 Hague Convention is to create obligations which are mutual as between the Contracting States to that Convention, that its intention is not to determine jurisdiction or indeed any other matter in relation to situations where the other state involved is a non-Contracting state.  She draws support for this from the wording of certain provisions of the Convention which clearly refer to other contracting states and she also relies on the decision of the House of Lords in  \n\t   Re J , (A Child) (Custody Rights: Jurisdiction)  [2005] UKHL 40 , [2005]  1 WLR 14which dealt with the sister convention, the 1980 Child Abduction Convention, when Baroness Hale stated very clearly that 1980 Hague Abduction Convention principles could not be imported into abduction cases where the other country was a non-contracting state."

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 30. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The parent opposing return may also establish a defence under Article 13(b) if they prove that 'there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation'.  The Supreme Court in  \n\t   E  held at [31-34] that Article 13(b), by its very terms, is of restricted application.  In addition to the burden being on the parent opposing return to establish the defence: \n\t     \n\t   30.1. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The risk of harm to the child must be 'grave'.  It is not enough that the risk be 'real'.  The risk must reach a certain level of seriousness as to be characterized as 'grave'.  Although 'grave' characterizes the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.  Thus, a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as 'grave' while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm:  \n\t     Re. E , [33]. \n\t     \n\t   30.2. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The child must be put at risk of 'physical or psychological harm' or otherwise placed in an 'intolerable situation'.  'Intolerable' gives colour to the term 'physical or psychological harm'.  It is a 'strong word', but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'.  Every child must put up with a certain level of 'rough and tumble, discomfort and distress', but there are 'some things it is not reasonable for a child to tolerate'.  Among these are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child, as well as 'exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent':  \n\t     Re. E , [34].  I return to this, below, under the heading 'controlling and coercive behaviour'. \n\t     \n\t   30.3. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Article 13(b) looks to the future: the situation as it would be if the child were to be returned forthwith to her home country, having regard to any protective measures that may be put in place to safeguard the child from such harm:  \n\t     Re. E , ibid, [35].  There may, objectively, be a 'grave risk' that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation if they are returned (whether with or without the removing parent) to live with the left-behind parent without any protective measures.  But if, for example, the child can be returned to a different setting, with effective restrictions on the left-behind parent having any contact with them and the removing parent, then the threshold required for Article 13(b) purposes will not be crossed.  The gravity of the risk of harm, including both its likelihood and the potential seriousness of the harm, needs to be evaluated in the light of the availability and efficacy of any protective measures.  'The clearer the need for protection, the more effective the protective measures must be':  Re. E , [52], cited in  Re. S (Abduction: Article 13(b)) (Mental Health)  [2023] EWCA Civ 208 , [92]. \n\t     \n\t 30.4. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Relevant protective measures may include anything which might reduce the risk, including general features of the home State such as access to the courts and other state services:  \n\t     Re. C   [2019] 1 FLR 1045 , [41].   The measures may also include orders made by the court in the requested state or undertakings given by the left-behind parent requiring them, for example, not to contact the removing parent pending the resolution of children's proceedings in the requesting state.  In assessing the efficacy of any such orders or undertakings, the fact that they are enforceable in the requesting state under the terms of the 1996 Hague Convention \n\t\t    is a relevant consideration:   Full name the 'Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children Protection of Children 1996' \n\t\t Re. Y (Abduction: Undertakings)   [2013] 2 FLR 649 .  If there is any doubt as to the availability or efficacy of protective measures, enquiries may be made through the international liaison judges and a short adjournment may be necessary for that purpose:  E v D  [2022] EWHC 1216 Fam, [32].

If that presumption is rebutted, the foundation for the acquired parental responsibility is displaced. Subsequently parental possibility will be lost by the order of the court that reflects the status of the individual adult and does not require a welfare analysis.  By contrast, where there is an application for a parental responsibility order or other orders that would grant parental responsibility to the applicant, the court will be tasked with undertaking a welfare analysis. This is a separate and different route through which parental responsibility may be awarded to the instance case.   Therefore, I grant the mother's application, order that N shall cease to have parental responsibility for C from the date that this judgment is handed down and invite the Registrar to reflect this on the register.

Offence of breaching order 4 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence. (2) In the case of an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 5(1), a person can be guilty of an offence under this paragraph only in respect of conduct engaged in at a time when the person was aware of the existence of the order.

(4) Paragraph 5 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Arrest under warrant 7 (1) An interested party may apply to the relevant judge for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person if the interested party considers that the person has failed to comply with an FGM protection order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to such an order.

(5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent.

(2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge.

(9B) Where this subsection appliesÄî (a) subsections (7) to (9) do not apply to the local authority, (b) the local authority must consider placing C with an individual within subsection (6)(a), and (c) where the local authority decide that a placement with such an individual is not the most appropriate placement for C, the local authority must consider placing C with a local authority foster parent who has been approved as a prospective adopter. (9C) Subsection (9B) does not apply where the local authority have applied for a placement order under section 21 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in respect of C and the application has been refused. (10) The local authority may determineÄî (a) the terms of any arrangements they make under subsection (2) in relation to C (including terms as to payment); and (b) the terms on which they place C with a local authority foster parent (including terms as to payment but subject to any order made under section 49 of the Children Act 2004).

It is understood that some 40,000 do so during the course of each year. The child will typically be protected from full exposure to the court room by the use of special measures, for example, answering questions over a live video link. Conversely, for many years the practice and culture in family proceedings was that such children, even if aged in their late teens, would never be required to give live evidence in the Family Court.  \n\t     \n\t   47. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The issue of children giving live evidence in family proceedings was considered in depth in the Supreme Court in the case of Re W (above). The Supreme Court held that the practice and culture of the Family Court that had hitherto applied, which amounted to a presumption against a child giving evidence, could not be justified and should be replaced by the court undertaking a bespoke evaluation in each case on the question of whether a complainant child should or should not be called to give live evidence. Baroness Hale JSC gave the judgment of the court. The following key passages are of importance: \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     [Paragraphs 22-28 of Re W quoted in full] \n\t     \n\t 48. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     I make no apology for quoting so extensively from Baroness Hale's judgment, which would seem to have gone unheeded in the five or more years since it was given. The need to give appropriate consideration to a child giving evidence in a case where that issue arises will soon be given further endorsement by amendments to the FPR 2010 and Practice Directions in accordance with recommendations from the President's working group on children and other vulnerable witnesses. In the meantime the decision in this case should serve as a firm reminder to the judiciary and to the profession of the need to engage fully with all that is required by Re W and the Guidelines.'"

As Mrs Odze has identified both children have strong views on where, and with whom, they should live, and I accept Ms Papazian's submissions that these need to be properly heard in any consideration of their welfare.  Having only Ms Mohapatra's evidence to guide me on the circumstances under which the Qatari courts will investigate and receive the views of the children I am not confident that these views will receive the prominence that they require.  The children will not be parties to any proceedings in Qatar, and I remain unclear (despite Ms Mohapatra's oral evidence) as to the circumstances under which a report into the children's views might be ordered from the Family Counselling Centre or the status that such a report might have in the Qatari proceedings. \n\t  "

The passage of time simply reinforced that view. I quite understand that it attempted to assist the Mother at an immensely difficult time for her, and has throughout been guided by what it believe is in the interests of W, but in my view there has been a loss of focus. In particular, the Local Authority did not sufficiently appreciate the importance of the notification issue,  \n\t     Cases A, B and C,  and the competing rights and interests of the Mother, W, the Father, and wider families. ii) The evidence presented about the Father is limited, but in my view, even on the MotherÄôs presentation, it is not sufficient for him to be excluded on a summary basis from being a possible carer, or if not a carer, from playing some other more limited role in WÄôs life. The concerns raised by the Mother are not of such gravity as to remove him entirely from the equation now.

She told the Guardian that had she known how these 10 months would unfold, she would have had the company of her mother at the birth.

Thus, the Lucas direction with respect to lies ( \n\t   R v Lucas  (1981) QB 720) is firmly established as a principle in the family court and, when determining allegations as to whether an injury is inflicted, the family court not infrequently relies upon the guidance in  R v Henderson and Others   [2010] EWCA Crim 1219  and  R v Cannings  [2004] 2 Crim Ap Reports 63, namely that the court should resist the temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child.

The first two examples do not concern definitions of criminal concepts or frameworks for establishing an offence. As Miss Fottrell KC submitted and I accept, these relate to the broader task of evaluating evidence more generally. Although in  F v M , Hayden J considered the substantive framework for the offence of coercive and controlling behaviour, he analysed such behaviour by reference to the definitions contained in the FPR, specifically disapproving of an overly formulaic analysis which might tend  'to obfuscate rather than illuminate'  the nature of such behaviour within family proceedings (see [108]).

The key lies in a careful consideration of the essential principles and scope of the legislation being interpreted. If the insertion of one word contracts those principles or goes beyond the scope of the legislation, it amounts to impermissible amendment. On the other hand, if the implication of a dozen words leaves the essential principles and scope of the legislation intact but allows it to be read in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, the implication is a legitimate exercise of the power conferred by  s 3(1) ."

This not an option on the court.

It is unnecessary for me to identify the judgments in issue since the relevance of those decisions was not the characterisation of behaviour by reference to concepts of consent or submission to sexual intercourse but rather that the court had accurately determined narrative findings which could inform the subsequent risk and welfare analysis. In that regard, I am very clear that the comments of the Court of Appeal at [71] in  \n\t   Re H-N  are crucial in underscoring the clear distinction between the family and the criminal court, namely that: \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'Behaviour which falls short of establishing 'rape', for example, may  nevertheless be profoundly abusive and should certainly not be ignored or met with a finding akin to 'not guilty' in the family context.

I do not propose to repeat these important paragraphs word for word. I distil the following principles:- \n\t       \n\t     (a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       The intention of  the Act  was the alleviation of the adverse consequences of no, or no adequate, financial provision being made by a foreign court in a situation where there were substantial connections with England and Wales \n\t       \n\t     (b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       The situation is different from an application that is made pursuant to the  Matrimonial Causes Act 1973  as Lord Collins makes plain that some of the matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant to section 18, and vice versa. \n\t       \n\t     (c) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       It is not the purpose of Part III to allow a spouse with some English connections to make an application in England and to take advantage of what may well be the more generous approach in England to financial provision, particularly in so-called big-money cases, although there is no condition of exceptionality. \n\t       \n\t     (d) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       Hardship or injustice is not a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction but, if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made and may affect the nature of the provision ordered. \n\t       \n\t     (e) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       The amount of the financial provision will depend on all the circumstances of the case and there is no rule that it should be the minimum amount required to overcome injustice. It will never be appropriate to give the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all the proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. Where possible, the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. \n\t       \n\t   (f) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       The grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full-blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief. \n\t     \n\t   56. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It is, therefore, clear that, as I am applying a different statute, different considerations apply compared to a pure  MCA 1973  application. In this regard, I agree with the observations of Coleridge J in Z v A [2012] EWHC 467;  [2012] 2 FLR 667 . It follows that I disagree with the observations of Mostyn J made at  [2014] [2014]   EWHC 3411 EWHC 3411 .  The award may be the same as it would have been under  the 1973 Act , if the English connections are very strong but, equally, it may not be. It all depends on the circumstances of the particular case being tried. \n\t     \n\t   57. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     I will have to make findings as to the connection between these parties and this country. I will have to determine whether it is appropriate or not to make an order in the first place. If I decide to do so, I will have to consider what order to make. It is rightly not suggested by Mr Pointer that this is a case for sharing. He approaches it on the basis that I should make an award to satisfy his client's reasonable needs, generously assessed, in the context of my findings as to the wealth of the parties. The concept of reasonable needs is, of course, a very elastic one. It is hard to argue with \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     the proposition that the vast majority of the population could cover their reasonable needs more than adequately on the net equity from the Paris property but this is not a normal case, given the sumptuous standard of living and the Wife's assertions as to the Husband's fortune. I will have to return to this in due course.'"

The only reason the consent was not recorded in writing was through lack of opportunity caused by the lack of clarity in the HFEA forms and the failure of the clinic to provide the relevant information. If this application was refused the interference with Mr Jennings' Article 8 rights would be significant; he would lose his only opportunity to realise his joint aim with Ms Choya to have a child together. Finally, there are no sufficiently weighty countervailing interests to justify the significant interference with Mr Jennings' Article 8 rights. There is no conflict between individual rights and granting the application would not undermine the core objectives of the legislative regime. \n\t  "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 52. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t \n\t   It is quite clear to me that the father's intention immediately prior to his departure on 5 January 2023, insofar as it was communicated to the mother, was to tie up all the arrangements which needed to be made in the Republic of Ireland and then to return to England 'for good'. He had keys to the family car which was left at the airport car park.  He accepts that he returned to their rented property and established contact with the landlord. In addition to confirming the formal termination of the lease which was held in the mother's name, there were several bin bags of the possessions which had come back from the time they spent under MM's roof, as the photographs show. The sale advertisements in relation to many of the larger items of furniture and other contents are consistent not only with the need to deliver vacant possession of the property at the conclusion of the tenancy but also the father's stated intention to return to England.  That intention is itself consistent with his agreement to enable the mother to relocate permanently with the children, as recorded on the face of the agreement he had signed. To the extent that he now seeks to resile from that position, I reject his evidence and accept what the mother told me about the plan as she understood it.  It may well have been a plan which was effected with an element of expedition, if not opportunism, on the part of the mother once the family arrived in England.  I accept that there were no prior or confirmed arrangements for housing or schooling.  However, as the run of texts makes plain, the father was very well aware that finding accommodation was always likely to present issues whenever the move was made.  Having left the Republic of Ireland and returned to England where she wanted to be, I suspect that the mother was indeed unable to contemplate a return to put in place a more orderly transition for the children.  That, by itself, does not in my judgment neutralise or render ineffective the consent which she had by then secured from the father to relocate permanently to this jurisdiction. If the father had at any point intended to withdraw his consent prior to the family's departure, he did nothing to inform the mother or make her aware of this change in his position. In this context I have considered carefully the one aspect of the mother's evidence about this which had troubled me. She accepts that return tickets were booked on 15 December last year.  She told me that she was under pressure from the father to book the return flights and she simply bowed to that pressure.  To the extent that the father denies telling her to book return tickets, I find the mother to be a more credible witness. Having now had an opportunity to consider this aspect of the evidence in the context of all the available evidence, including the exchange of text messages, I have concluded that she was being truthful when she told me in both her written and oral evidence that she was fearful that the father would renege on his consent. I accept that, to her, the written consent he had signed was indeed an 'insurance policy' on which she could rely in that event.  Having concluded that she could not return to the Republic of Ireland once she reached what was to her the safety represented by her support network in England, she made it plain to the father that she was intending to remain."

In considering the terms of the will, which was expressed in general terms, with no reference to that particular form of treatment and use of gametes the Inner House considered other evidence to reach the conclusions that it did. As was stated at paragraph 21  'The authority accepts that treatment by IVF appears to have been in the contemplation of JB, and the affidavit of SB makes this clear.

Hayden J noted that the concept of dignity is, \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   'ï¿½Ä¶ mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948, the Preamble to which states that 'recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world', and Article 1 of which provides that 'all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'.' \n\t     \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t     Hayden J set out many other international conventions and documents that refer to the 'inherent dignity of all human beings' or similarly to the requirement to prevent the violation of  'respect for human dignity'. He then concluded at [63] and [64]: \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     'Though it is an ambitious objective to seek to draw from the above texts, drafted in differing jurisdictions and in a variety of contexts, unifying principles underpinning the concept of human dignity, there is a striking thematic consistency. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of what emerges: \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     i. human dignity is predicated on a universal understanding that human beings possess a unique value which is intrinsic to the human condition; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     ii. an individual has an inviolable right to be valued, respected and treated ethically, solely because he/she is a human being; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     iii. human dignity should not be regarded merely as a facet of human rights but as the foundation for them. Logically, it both establishes and substantiates the construction of human rights; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     iv. thus, the protection of human dignity and the rights that flow therefrom is to be regarded as an indispensable priority; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     v. the inherent dignity of a human being imposes an obligation on the State actively to protect the dignity of all human beings. This involves guaranteeing respect for human integrity, fundamental rights and freedoms. Axiomatically, this prescribes the avoidance of discrimination; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     vi. compliance with these principles may result in legitimately diverging opinions as to how best to preserve or promote human dignity, but it does not alter the nature of it nor will it ever obviate the need for rigorous enquiry. \n\t       \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Thus, whilst there is and can be no defining characteristic of human dignity, it is clear that respect for personal autonomy is afforded pre-eminence. Each case will be both situational and person specific. In this respect there is a striking resonance both with the framework of the  \n\t       Mental Capacity Act 2005  and the jurisprudence which underpins it. The forensic approach is 'subjective', in the sense that it requires all involved, family members, treating clinicians, the Courts to conduct an intense focus on the individual at the centre of the process. Frequently, it will involve drilling down into the person's life, considering what he or she may have said or written and a more general evaluation of the code and values by which they have lived their life.'"

Pursuant to the  \n\t   Children and Adoption Act 2006   s.9(6) , the Secretary of State for Education has power to declare that special restrictions are to apply for the time being in relation to the bringing in of children to the United Kingdom for the purpose of adoption from a particular country.  Within this context, special restrictions were imposed by the Secretary of State for Education in relation to adoptions from Nigeria by the Special Restrictions on Adoptions from Abroad (Nigeria) Order 2021, which came into effect on 12 March 2021.

However, that basic principle is subject to a number of caveats, including where limited disclosure is necessary following a proper balancing of the competing ECHR rights involved,  Re B (Disclosure to Other Parties)   [2001] 2 FLR 1017 .

(2) In family proceedings, no party to the proceedings who is protected by an on-notice protective injunction may cross-examine in person a witness against whom the injunction is in force. (3) Cross-examination in breach of subsection (1) or (2) does not affect the validity of a decision of the court in the proceedings if the court was not aware of the protective injunction when the cross-examination took place. (4) In this section ' protective injunction ' means an order, injunction or interdict specified, or of a description specified, in regulations made by the Lord Chancellor.

(3) In this section' ' domestic abuse ' has the meaning given by section 1 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021; ' specified evidence ' means evidence specified, or of a description specified, in regulations made by the Lord Chancellor. (4) Regulations under subsection (3) may provide that any evidence which satisfies the court that domestic abuse, or domestic abuse of a specified description, has occurred is specified evidence for the purposes of this section. 31U Direction for prohibition of cross-examination in person: other cases (1) In family proceedings, the court may give a direction prohibiting a party to the proceedings from cross-examining (or continuing to cross-examine) a witness in person if' (a) none of sections 31R to 31T operates to prevent the party from cross-examining the witness, and (b) it appears to the court that' (i) the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met, and (ii) it would not be contrary to the interests of justice to give the direction. (2) The 'quality condition' is met if the quality of evidence given by the witness on cross-examination' (a) is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) is conducted by the party in person, and (b) would be likely to be improved if a direction were given under this section. (3) The 'significant distress condition' is met if' (a) the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) of the witness by the party in person would be likely to cause significant distress to the witness or the party, and (b) that distress is likely to be more significant than would be the case if the witness were cross-examined other than by the party in person. (4) A direction under this section may be made by the court' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (e) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (f) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (g) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (h) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party. (6) Any reference in this section to the quality of a witness's evidence is to its quality in terms of completeness, coherence and accuracy. (7) For this purpose ' coherence ' refers to a witness's ability in giving evidence to give answers which' (a) address the questions put to the witness, and (b) can be understood, both individually and collectively. 31V Directions under section 31U: supplementary (1) A direction under section 31U has binding effect from the time it is made until the witness in relation to whom it applies is discharged. (2) But the court may revoke a direction under section 31U before the witness is discharged, if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so, either' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (3) The court may revoke a direction under section 31U on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since' (a) the direction was given, or (b) if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. (4) The court must state its reasons for' (a) giving a direction under section 31U; (b) refusing an application for a direction under section 31U; (c) revoking a direction under section 31U; (d) refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 31U. 31W Alternatives to cross-examination in person (1) This section applies where a party to family proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 31R to 31U. (2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. (5) The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. (6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party. (7) A qualified legal representative appointed by the court under subsection (6) is not responsible to the party. (8) For the purposes of this section' (a) a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; (b) ' qualified legal representative ' means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in family proceedings. 31X Costs of legal representatives appointed under section 31W(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision for the payment out of central funds of sums in respect of' (a) fees or costs properly incurred by a qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6), and (b) expenses properly incurred in providing such a person with evidence or other material in connection with the appointment. (2) The regulations may provide for sums payable under subsection (1) to be determined by the Lord Chancellor or such other person as the regulations may specify. (3) The regulations may provide for sums payable under subsection (1)' (a) to be such amounts as are specified in the regulations; (b) to be calculated in accordance with' (i) a rate or scale specified in the regulations, or (ii) other provision made by or under the regulations. 31Y Guidance for legal representatives appointed under section 31W(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may issue guidance in connection with the role which a qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6) in connection with any family proceedings is to play in the proceedings, including (among other things) guidance about the effect of section 31W(7). (2) A qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6) must have regard to any guidance issued under this section. (3) The Lord Chancellor may from time to time revise any guidance issued under this section. (4) The Lord Chancellor must publish' (a) any guidance issued under this section, and (b) any revisions of that guidance. 31Z Regulations under Part 4B (1) Any power of the Lord Chancellor to make regulations under this Part' (a) is exercisable by statutory instrument, (b) includes power to make different provision for different purposes, and (c) includes power to make supplementary, incidental, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision. (2) A statutory instrument containing regulations under this Part is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament." ] ,

In the field of family law, adoption is the most draconian intervention that the state, through the local authority and the court, may make into a childÄôs family life. It will only be justified, or regarded as a proportionate step to take, when there is no other arrangement that is likely to meet the childÄôs life-long welfare needs. Here, there is no guarantee that a placement for all three children together will be found. The local authority are intent on keeping the children together as three siblings and, if after 12 months no adoptive home has been found, the search will cease and the care plan will be reviewed. The difficulty in finding a placement for three children together will be enhanced because of the importance of attempting to match the placement with their racial and cultural characteristics, because of RÄôs age and because there is concern over the intellectual development of one of the children. The professional evidence, which I accept, is that these factors do not rule out the prospect of finding a family and the social workers, with their eyes fully open to these factors, nevertheless consider that it is probable that a family will be found. This outcome cannot, however, be guaranteed. Thus, whilst the route to adoption and the planned work is clear, success cannot be assured.  \n\t  "

(5) At the hearing of any proceedings in the family court in which there is a right of appeal or from which an appeal may be brought with permission, the judge, if requested to do so by any party, is to make a note' (a) of any question of law raised at the hearing, (b) of the facts in evidence in relation to any such question, and (c) of the court's decision on any such question and of the court's determination of the proceedings. (6) Where such a note is made, and whether or not an appeal has been made, the court' (a) on the application of any party to the proceedings, and (b) on payment of the fee (if any) prescribed under section 92 of the Courts Act 2003, is to provide that party with a copy of the note signed by the judge, and the copy so signed is to be used at the hearing of any appeal. (7) Section 81 of the County Courts Act 1984 (powers of Court of Appeal on appeal from county court) applies to appeals from the family court to the Court of Appeal as it applies to appeals from the county court to the Court of Appeal. (8) The Lord Chief Justice may nominate a judicial office holder (as defined in section 109(4) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005) to exercise functions of the Lord Chief Justice under subsection (3)." ] ,

It may have also been possible for SWE to have sought further information about the court's findings from the mother ' or indeed from the father ' but to have done so ran the risk that either the mother or the father would have been in contempt of court for revealing information about the family court's decision without the court's express permission. Revealing the information in this way would also have left the child's identity and confidentiality unprotected and at the mercy of SWE's own processes rather than being in the control of the family court as should be the case with a child subject to ongoing family court proceedings as Z was. \n\t  "

The baleful and insidious risk of harm to both M and EF given my factual findings of F's controlling and coercive behaviour is such that I would not expose them to that risk.  It is also relevant that a period of nearly 11 months elapsed between the date of removal (17 December 2021) and the date these proceedings were commenced (1 November 2022).  Had a year passed the automatic duty to return in Article 12 would have been qualified by considerations of whether EF had settled in the UK.   The period of time that has elapsed, during which time EF has undoubtedly become more settled in the UK, is relevant to the exercise of the court's discretion: the longer the period, the less weighty the Convention considerations and the more weight is to be given to other welfare considerations.  In any event, F's failure to attend these proceedings leaves me with little confidence that he is pursuing them because of his concern for his daughter's best interests rather than as a further means of controlling M."

(6) No court shall exercise the powers conferred by this section in respect of a child who is not legally represented in that court unless, having been informed of his right to apply for the provision of representation under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and having had the opportunity to do so, he refused or failed to apply.

It is, of course, wholly different if the child lacks capacity for the reasons explained above.  In my judgment, the statutory purpose of  section 25  CA is to define the tests that should be met before a child can lawfully be placed in secure accommodation.

(5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (e) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (f) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (g) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (h) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party. (6) Any reference in this section to the quality of a witness's evidence is to its quality in terms of completeness, coherence and accuracy. (7) For this purpose ' coherence ' refers to a witness's ability in giving evidence to give answers which' (a) address the questions put to the witness, and (b) can be understood, both individually and collectively. 31V Directions under section 31U: supplementary (1) A direction under section 31U has binding effect from the time it is made until the witness in relation to whom it applies is discharged. (2) But the court may revoke a direction under section 31U before the witness is discharged, if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so, either' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (3) The court may revoke a direction under section 31U on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since' (a) the direction was given, or (b) if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. (4) The court must state its reasons for' (a) giving a direction under section 31U; (b) refusing an application for a direction under section 31U; (c) revoking a direction under section 31U; (d) refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 31U. 31W Alternatives to cross-examination in person (1) This section applies where a party to family proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 31R to 31U. (2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. (5) The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. (6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party. (7) A qualified legal representative appointed by the court under subsection (6) is not responsible to the party. (8) For the purposes of this section' (a) a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; (b) ' qualified legal representative ' means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in family proceedings. 31X Costs of legal representatives appointed under section 31W(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision for the payment out of central funds of sums in respect of' (a) fees or costs properly incurred by a qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6), and (b) expenses properly incurred in providing such a person with evidence or other material in connection with the appointment. (2) The regulations may provide for sums payable under subsection (1) to be determined by the Lord Chancellor or such other person as the regulations may specify. (3) The regulations may provide for sums payable under subsection (1)' (a) to be such amounts as are specified in the regulations; (b) to be calculated in accordance with' (i) a rate or scale specified in the regulations, or (ii) other provision made by or under the regulations. 31Y Guidance for legal representatives appointed under section 31W(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may issue guidance in connection with the role which a qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6) in connection with any family proceedings is to play in the proceedings, including (among other things) guidance about the effect of section 31W(7). (2) A qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6) must have regard to any guidance issued under this section. (3) The Lord Chancellor may from time to time revise any guidance issued under this section. (4) The Lord Chancellor must publish' (a) any guidance issued under this section, and (b) any revisions of that guidance. 31Z Regulations under Part 4B (1) Any power of the Lord Chancellor to make regulations under this Part' (a) is exercisable by statutory instrument, (b) includes power to make different provision for different purposes, and (c) includes power to make supplementary, incidental, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision. (2) A statutory instrument containing regulations under this Part is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament." ] ,

In this regard, the  procedural  manner in which the hearing is conducted and, in particular, the scope of cross examination of an alleged victim as to their sexual history, past relationships or medical history, justify consideration separately from the general prohibition in determining the  substantive  allegation. Nothing that is said in Re R, or endorsed in this judgement, should inhibit further consideration of such procedural matters. They are beyond the scope of this judgement and are more properly to be considered elsewhere.'"

(2) The paramount consideration of the court or adoption agency must be the childÄôs welfare, throughout his life. (3) The court or adoption agency must at all times bear in mind that, in general, any delay in coming to the decision is likely to prejudice the childÄôs welfare. (4) The court or adoption agency must have regard to the following matters (among others)Äî (a) the childÄôs ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision (considered in the light of the childÄôs age and understanding), (b) the childÄôs particular needs, (c) the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person, (d) the childÄôs age, sex, background and any of the childÄôs characteristics which the court or agency considers relevant, (e) any harm (within the meaning of the Children Act 1989 (c. 41)) which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering, (f) the relationship which the child has with relatives, with any person who is a prospective adopter with whom the child is placed, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant, includingÄî (i) the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so, (ii) the ability and willingness of any of the childÄôs relatives, or of any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the childÄôs needs, (iii) the wishes and feelings of any of the childÄôs relatives, or of any such person, regarding the child. (5) In placing a child for adoption, an adoption agency in Wales must give due consideration to the childÄôs religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background. (6) In coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child, a court or adoption agency must always consider the whole range of powers available to it in the childÄôs case (whether under this Act or the Children Act 1989); and the court must not make any order under this Act unless it considers that making the order would be better for the child than not doing so. (7) In this section, Äú coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child Äù, in relation to a court, includesÄî (a) coming to a decision in any proceedings where the orders that might be made by the court include an adoption order (or the revocation of such an order), a placement order (or the revocation of such an order) or an order under section 26 or 51A (or the revocation or variation of such an order), (b) coming to a decision about granting leave in respect of any action (other than the initiation of proceedings in any court) which may be taken by an adoption agency or individual under this Act, but does not include coming to a decision about granting leave in any other circumstances. (8) For the purposes of this sectionÄî (a) references to relationships are not confined to legal relationships, (b) references to a relative, in relation to a child, include the childÄôs mother and father. (9) In this section Äú adoption agency in Wales Äù means an adoption agency that isÄî (a) a local authority in Wales, or (b) a registered adoption society whose principal office is in Wales." ] ,

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 23. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   Counsel were both agreed that the approach that should be taken by the court to such applications was set out carefully by the Court of Appeal in  Re A & Others   [2020] EWCA Civ 41 ;  [2020] Fam 325 .  There Peter Jackson LJ held at [89]: \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'The principles governing decisions (by local authorities as adoption agencies or by the court) as to whether a putative father or a relative should be informed of the existence of a child who might be adopted can be summarised in this way. \n\t     \n\t   (1) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The law allows for 'fast-track adoption' with the consent of all those with parental responsibility, so in some cases the mother alone. Where she opposes notification being given to the child's father or relatives her right to respect for her private life is engaged and can only be infringed where it is necessary to do so to protect the interests of others. \n\t     \n\t   (2) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The profound importance of the adoption decision for the child and potentially for other family members is clearly capable of supplying a justification for overriding the mother's request. Whether it does so will depend upon the individual circumstances of the case. \n\t     \n\t   (3) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The decision should be prioritised, and the process characterised by urgency and thoroughness. \n\t     \n\t   (4) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The decision-makers first task is to establish the facts as clearly as possible, mindful of the often limited and one-sided nature of the information available. The confidential relinquishment of a child for adoption is an unusual event and the reasons for it must be respectfully scrutinised so that the interests of others are protected. In fairness to those other individuals, the account that is given by the person seeking confidentiality cannot be taken at face value. All information that can be discovered without compromising confidentiality should therefore be gathered and a first-hand account from the person seeking confidentiality will normally be sought. The investigation should enable broad conclusions to be drawn about the relative weight to be given to the factors that must inform the decision. \n\t     \n\t   (5) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Once the facts have been investigated the task is to strike a fair balance between the various interests involved. The welfare of the child is an important factor but it is not the paramount consideration. \n\t     \n\t   (6) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     There is no single test for distinguishing between cases in which notification should and should not be given but the case law shows that these factors will be relevant when reaching a decision: \n\t     \n\t   (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Parental responsibility. The fact that a father has parental responsibility by marriage or otherwise entitles him to give or withhold consent to adoption and gives him automatic party status in any proceedings that might lead to adoption. Compelling reasons are therefore required before the withholding of notification can be justified. \n\t     \n\t   (ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Article 8 rights. Whether the father, married or unmarried, or the relative have an established or potential family life with the mother or the child, the right to a fair hearing is engaged and strong reasons are required before the withholding of notification can be justified. \n\t     \n\t   (iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The substance of the relationships. Aside from the presence or absence of parental responsibility and of family life rights, an assessment must be made of the substance of the relationship between the parents, the circumstances of the conception, and the significance of relatives. The purpose is to ensure that those who are necessarily silent are given a notional voice so as to identify the possible strengths and weaknesses of any argument that they might make. Put another way, with what degree of objective justification might such a person complain if they later discovered they had been excluded from the decision? The answer will differ as between a father with whom the mother has had a fleeting encounter and one with whom she has had a substantial relationship, and as between members of the extended family who are close to the parents and those who are more distant. \n\t     \n\t   (iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The likelihood of a family placement being a realistic alternative to adoption. This is of particular importance to the child's lifelong welfare as it may determine whether or not adoption is necessary. An objective view, going beyond the say-so of the person seeking confidentiality, should be taken about whether a family member may or may not be a potential carer. Where a family placement is unlikely to be worth investigating or where notification may cause significant harm to those notified, this factor will speak in favour of maintaining confidentiality; anything less than that and it will point the other way. \n\t     \n\t   (v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The physical, psychological or social impact on the mother or on others of notification being given. Where this would be severe, for example because of fear arising from rape or violence, or because of possible consequences such as ostracism or family breakdown, or because of significant mental health vulnerability, these must weigh heavily in the balancing exercise. On the other hand, excessive weight should not be given to short term difficulties and to less serious situations involving embarrassment or social unpleasantness, otherwise the mothers wish would always prevail at the expense of other interests. \n\t     \n\t   (vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Cultural and religious factors. The conception and concealed pregnancy may give rise to particular difficulties in some cultural and religious contexts. These may enhance the risks of notification, but they may also mean that the possibility of maintaining the birth tie through a family placement is of particular importance for the child. \n\t     \n\t   (vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The availability and durability of the confidential information. Notification can only take place if there is someone to notify. In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child's existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind. \n\t     \n\t   (viii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The impact of delay. A decision to apply to court and thereafter any decision to notify will inevitably postpone to some extent the time when the child's permanent placement can be confirmed. In most cases, the importance of the issues means that the delay cannot be a predominant factor. There may however be circumstances where delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother or for the child; for example, it would undoubtedly need to be taken into account if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child's established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement. \n\t     \n\t   (ix) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Any other relevant matters. The list of relevant factors is not closed. Mothers may have many reasons for wishing to maintain confidentiality and there may be a wide range of implications for the child, the father and for other relatives. All relevant matters must be considered. \n\t     \n\t (7) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It has rightly been said that the maintenance of confidentiality is exceptional, and highly exceptional where a father has parental responsibility or where there is family life under article 8. However exceptionality is not in itself a test or a short cut; rather it is a reflection of the fact that the profound significance of adoption for the child and considerations of fairness to others means that the balance will often fall in favour of notification. But the decision on whether confidentiality should be maintained can only be made by striking a fair balance between the factors that are present in the individual case.'"

The measures covered by Article 1 include guardianship, curatorship and analogous institutions, the designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's person or property, representing or assisting the child, the placement of a child in foster care, family or institutional care, and the supervision by a public authority of the care of a child by any person having charge of them.  Those measures are not identical to  but very similar to those covered by Article 1(2) of Brussels IIA, which also covers guardianship, curatorship and similar institutions, designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's personal property, representing or assistance of the child and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care.  Both of them self-evidently also cover general matters of attribution, exercise, termination or restriction of parental responsibility.  So the subject matter of both the 1996 Convention and Brussels IIA are very similar and so I have no doubt that the 1996 Hague Convention applies to public law proceedings, in the same way that Brussels IIA did. \n\t  "

(3) It shall be the duty of a court hearing an application under this section to determine whether any relevant criteria for keeping a child in secure accommodation are satisfied in his case. (4) If a court determines that any such criteria are satisfied, it shall make an order authorising the child to be kept in secure accommodation and specifying the maximum period for which he may be so kept. (5) On any adjournment of the hearing of an application under this section, a court may make an interim order permitting the child to be kept during the period of the adjournment in secure accommodation. (5A) Where a local authority in England or Wales are authorised under this section to keep a child in secure accommodation in Scotland, the person in charge of the accommodation may restrict the childÄôs liberty to the extent that the person considers appropriate, having regard to the terms of any order made by a court under this section. (6) No court shall exercise the powers conferred by this section in respect of a child who is not legally represented in that court unless, having been informed of his right to apply for the provision of representation under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and having had the opportunity to do so, he refused or failed to apply. (7) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide thatÄî (a) this section shall or shall not apply to any description of children specified in the regulations; (b) this section shall have effect in relation to children of a description specified in the regulations subject to such modifications as may be so specified; (c) such other provisions as may be so specified shall have effect for the purpose of determining whether a child of a description specified in the regulations may be placed or kept in secure accommodation in England or Scotland . (d) a child may only be placed in secure accommodation that is of a description specified in the regulations (and the description may in particular be framed by reference to whether the accommodation, or the person providing it, has been approved by the Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers).

Those measures are not identical to  but very similar to those covered by Article 1(2) of Brussels IIA, which also covers guardianship, curatorship and similar institutions, designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's personal property, representing or assistance of the child and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care.

(2) Without prejudice to any general power to make rules of court, such rules may make provision for regulating matters relating to the costs of those proceedings including, in particular, prescribing scales of costs to be paid to legal or other representatives or for securing that the amount awarded to a party in respect of the costs to be paid by him to such representatives is not limited to what would have been payable by him to them if he had not been awarded costs. .

(7) In subsection (6), ' wasted costs ' means any costs incurred by a party' (a) as a result of any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission on the part of any legal or other representative or any employee of such a representative; or (b) which, in the light of any such act or omission occurring after they were incurred, the court considers it is unreasonable to expect that party to pay.

I do not, however, consider that it is either fair or proportionate to order that she should pay all of his costs. For reasons that have already been set out, the appeal process took off and moved on out of the mother's direct control. Taking a very high level approach, and without looking at any minute apportionment of responsibility, I consider that it is appropriate for there to be an order that the mother should pay one half of the father's costs of the appeal , that being half of the father's costs in the disclosed costs schedule for the appeal hearing. Approaching the issue in the manner described in  \n\t   Arcadia Group Brands Ltd , I do not consider that the mother's litigation conduct has gone beyond promoting a hopeless case; there is no evidence of some ulterior motive. The position seems to be that she simply does not, and will not, accept the sound findings that HHJ Davies has made. The costs order will therefore be on the standard basis and the father's application for costs on an indemnity basis is refused. (The mother has, since my draft judgment was provided to Counsel, now agreed with the father to pay the father's costs in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½26,176,79 within 3 months of the date of this judgment rather than seek detailed assessment, and that will be reflected in my order). \n\t     \n\t (b) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Ms Gill's application for costs"

In most cases, the importance of the issues means that the delay cannot be a predominant factor. There may however be circumstances where delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother or for the child; for example, it would undoubtedly need to be taken into account if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child's established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement.

(2) The 'quality condition' is met if the quality of evidence given by the witness on cross-examination' (a) is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) is conducted by the party in person, and (b) would be likely to be improved if a direction were given under this section. (3) The 'significant distress condition' is met if' (a) the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) of the witness by the party in person would be likely to cause significant distress to the witness or the party, and (b) that distress is likely to be more significant than would be the case if the witness were cross-examined other than by the party in person. (4) A direction under this section may be made by the court' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the party in relation to the witness; (e) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the witness in relation to the party; (f) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (g) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (h) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (i) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (j) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party. (6) In subsection (5)(d) and (e) ' specified offence ' means an offence that is a specified offence for the purposes of section 85F.

(2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness.

(6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party.

(8) For the purposes of this section' (a) a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; (b) ' qualified legal representative ' means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in civil proceedings. 85L Costs of legal representatives appointed under section 85K(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision for the payment out of central funds of sums in respect of' (a) fees or costs properly incurred by a qualified legal representative appointed under section 85K(6), and (b) expenses properly incurred in providing such a person with evidence or other material in connection with the appointment.

It is unlikely that this will often be the conclusion reached but as I have already had cause to observe, Maya's circumstances are strikingly unusual."

Whilst a judge undertaking a Dispute Resolution Appointment is required to consider the extent to which the remaining issues between the parties can be resolved at that hearing, and to assist the parties to do so with a frank evaluation of the evidence, this cannot extend to making final orders where it is clear that a party continues to contest the matter and to seek a different outcome.  Where a party continues to dispute the outcome of the proceedings at the Dispute Resolution Hearing, PD12B provides a clear way forward, either in the form of hearing evidence at the Dispute Resolution Appointment in order to resolve or further narrow the issues or in the form of final case management directions towards a final hearing.   Given the contents of the Cafcass report in this case, the judge was entitled to express the views he did regarding the difficulties faced by father on his case.  However, in circumstances where it was apparent that the father disputed the recommendations of the Cafcass report, continued to seek direct contact with the children and, albeit in somewhat opaque terms, sought a final hearing, the proper course was to make tight case management directions to a short final hearing, in particular identifying and specifying the key issues to be determined at that final hearing and on which the court would wish to hear limited evidence.   \n\t  "

(2) The court may not entertain an application under this section unless' (a) the applicant or the respondent is domiciled in England and Wales on the date of the application; (b) the applicant has been habitually resident there throughout the period of one year ending with that date; or (c) the respondent is resident there on that date. (2A) If the application or part of it relates to a matter in relation to which Article 18 of the 2007 Hague Convention applies, the court may not entertain that application or part of it except where permitted by Article 18. (2B) In subsection (2A), 'the 2007 Hague Convention' means the Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance concluded on 23 November 2007 at The Hague. (3) Where an application under this section is made on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(a) above, then, in deciding' (a) whether the respondent has failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant, and (b) what order, if any, to make under this section in favour of the applicant, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters mentioned in section 25(2) above, and where an application is also made under this section in respect of a child of the family who has not attained the age of eighteen, first consideration shall be given to the welfare of the child while a minor. (3A) Where an application under this section is made on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above then, in deciding' (a) whether the respondent has failed to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for the child of the family to whom the application relates, and (b) what order, if any, to make under this section in favour of the child, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters mentioned in section 25(3)(a) to (e) above, and where the child of the family to whom the application relates is not the child of the respondent, including also the matters mentioned in section 25(4) above. (3B) In relation to an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(a) above, section 25(2)(c) above shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the breakdown of the marriage there were substituted a reference to the failure to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant, and in relation to an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above, section 25(2)(c) above (as it applies by virtue of section 25(3)(e) above) shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the breakdown of the marriage there were substituted a reference to the failure to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for the child of the family to whom the application relates. (5) Where on an application under this section it appears to the court that the applicant or any child of the family to whom the application relates is in immediate need of financial assistance, but it is not yet possible to determine what order, if any, should be made on the application, the court may make an interim order for maintenance, that is to say, an order requiring the respondent to make to the applicant until the determination of the application such periodical payments as the court thinks reasonable. (6) Where on an application under this section the applicant satisfies the court of any ground mentioned in subsection (1) above, the court may make any one or more of the following orders , that is to say' (a) an order that the respondent shall make to the applicant such periodical payments, for such term, as may be specified in the order; (b) an order that the respondent shall secure to the applicant, to the satisfaction of the court, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (c) an order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant such lump sum as may be so specified; (d) an order that the respondent shall make to such person as may be specified in the order for the benefit of the child to whom the application relates, or to that child, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (e) an order that the respondent shall secure to such person as may be so specified for the benefit of that child, or to that child, to the satisfaction of the court, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (f) an order that the respondent shall pay to such person as may be so specified for the benefit of that child, or to that child, such lump sum as may be so specified; subject, however, in the case of an order under paragraph (d), (e) or (f) above, to the restrictions imposed by section 29(1) and (3) below on the making of financial provision orders in favour of children who have attained the age of eighteen. (6A) An application for the variation under section 31 of this Act of a periodical payments order or secured periodical payments order made under this section in favour of a child may, if the child has attained the age of sixteen, be made by the child himself. (6B) Where a periodical payments order made in favour of a child under this section ceases to have effect on the date on which the child attains the age of sixteen or at any time after that date but before or on the date on which he attains the age of eighteen, then if, on an application made to the court for an order under this subsection, it appears to the court that' (a) the child is, will be or (if an order were made under this subsection) would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade, profession or vocation, whether or not he also is, will be or would be in gainful employment; or (b) there are special circumstances which justify the making of an order under this subsection, the court shall have power by order to revive the first mentioned order from such date as the court may specify, not being earlier than the date of the making of the application, and to exercise its power under section 31 of this Act in relation to any order so revived.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   The order I intend to make \n\t     \n\t   73. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Contrary to the submissions of Mr Marks on the Husband's behalf, I am clear that I should make an order.  I would have done so absent the Agreement.  As a result of the repudiation, it is likely that the Agreement is no longer enforceable in Germany.  Despite what I would characterise as the Wife's foolishness in repudiating it, I do not consider she should be in any worse position than if she had never been to either Zurich or Dusseldorf.  An agreement was reached and it should now be encapsulated in an order.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   74. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I have had to consider carefully how to do so to be entirely fair to both parties.  The lump sum is easy.  I order that the Husband pay the Wife ï¿½Ç¨1.5 million on 1 August 2022 and ï¿½Ç¨1.5 million on 1 August 2023.  The maintenance is also relatively straightforward.  I order that he pay her ï¿½Ç¨40,000 per month by way of secured provision from 1 August 2022 payable monthly in advance during her life-time or until further order.  I accept that there must be a remarriage clause.  The Husband is not domiciled in this jurisdiction.  Although the secured provision, in theory, means that the order survives his death, I entirely understand the Wife's concern as to this aspect.  It is clear to me that the Dusseldorf Agreement envisaged her being secure in the knowledge that she would receive this money even if the Husband were to die.  I require the Husband to make arrangements to ensure that the Wife will receive the money even after his death, if she survives him. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   75. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I very much hope that there will not be any difficulty in my order being complied with.  I do take the view that Valentin is likely to assist in ensuring that this is the case.  I do, however, have to guard against the possibility that it will not be.  I take the view that I can capitalise my order at any future stage if that becomes appropriate.  If the Husband were to fail to commence payment of the amount he agreed, I would be minded to capitalise the entire payment in the autumn of this year on application by the Wife.  If he were not able to put in place satisfactory proposals to ensure the Wife received her entitlement after his death, I would again be minded to capitalise the provision but I consider he should have a year from now to make those arrangements. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   76. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to the trickiest part, namely Kinnerton Street.  Again, I intend to abide by the Dusseldorf Agreement.  My order will be that the property is settled upon the Wife pursuant to  \n\t     section 24 (b) of  the 1973 Act  to ensure that she has the exclusive right of occupation of the property for the remainder of her life.  There will then be two deferred contingent lump sums.  The first will be in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 payable on 1 August 2024, index linked in accordance with the CPI, if the Husband, or Valentin, has not acquired the freehold or extended the lease on Kinnerton Street to one of at least fifty years by that date.  This corresponds with the Agreement, which makes provision for an alternative property if it is not possible to purchase the freehold or extend the leasehold.  I cannot see how it would not be possible to extend the lease as I believe that is a legal entitlement.  Nevertheless, if it has not been done, the lump sum becomes payable.  The Wife would then have to give up her right of occupation in Kinnerton Street on payment in full of the contingent lump sum.  The second deferred lump sum will be for the refurbishment works.  Again, the Husband will pay the Wife the sum of ï¿½ï¿½900,000 on 1 August 2024 if he or Valentin has not, by that date, expended at least ï¿½ï¿½800,000 on the provision of refurbishment works/improvement works to the property.   \n\t     \n\t   77. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   These parties have now been involved in bitter contested litigation for a number of years.  It is time it ended.  The parties wanted it to end when they met in Dusseldorf on 20 May 2022.  I now expect it to end on the terms of that Dusseldorf Agreement.  After all, both parties were content with it as a proper solution as recently as 20 May 2022.  They even toasted it with champagne.  I do believe that Valentin will do everything in his power to ensure it is now fully acted upon.  I am grateful to him for that.  It is vital to his mother's future and I very much want his relationship with her to be restored after this immensely damaging process.  I very much hope the Husband will see the sense in this as well.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t 78. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I want to pay tribute to all the assistance I have had with this difficult case.  Nothing more could have been said or done on behalf of either party. \n\t    "

He misrepresented that the applicant's whereabouts were not known to him and/or that he had no means of communicating with her, when he knew that was not true; in the words of Holman J in  Olafsoye , the respondent ' effectively cheated ' the applicant. \n\t     \n\t   ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It matters that an order of the significance of a divorce order affecting individuals' marital status is obtained fairly and that due process rights, including notice to the other party, are properly observed; \n\t     \n\t   iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     As a result of the respondent's dishonesty before the Indonesian court, the court was not able to take effective steps to serve or otherwise notify the applicant and the applicant was therefore deprived of the opportunity of participating in the Indonesian divorce proceedings, which may have included making representations as to jurisdiction and, according to Mr Sriro, would include the applicability of English law principles to what was, after all, the dissolution of an English marriage. \n\t     \n\t   iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Any 'limping marriage' will be short-lived because the applicant seeks, within the English divorce proceedings with due notice to the respondent, to have the stay lifted to enable her to proceed to the pronouncement of a final order of divorce. \n\t     \n\t   v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     As noted by Hollings J in  Kendall v Kendall   [1977] 3 WLR 251 , the principles of comity do not require the court to recognise a decree which would surely have been set aside by the foreign court if that court were apprised of the facts as this court finds them to be. \n\t     \n\t   vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Although the applicant's failure to refer to the Indonesian divorce in her divorce petition has incurred some delay, this is outweighed by the delay incurred by the consequences of the respondent's deliberate failure to inform the Indonesian court of the whereabouts of and means to contact the applicant, which he knew. \n\t     \n\t vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     \n\t     Although the applicant would have the ability to make an application under Part III of the  Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 , the issue of permission is currently before the Supreme Court whose decision may change her entitlement to such relief. Furthermore, there is a material difference between the fundamental basis of a financial remedy application under the  Matrimonial Causes Act 1973  and an application under Part III. As Cohen J said in  Radseresht v Radseresht-Spain   [2018] 1 FLR 1443  at ï¿½?36,  \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       'ï¿½Ä¶it does not follow that if the wife did get leave under Part III, ï¿½Ä¶ that the relief she obtained would be the same as she would obtain under a financial remedy application under the  Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 . Thus, her interests are not protected.'"

Therefore, consent for use of a partner-created embryo in treatment with a surrogate must specify both the purposes mentioned in paragraphs 2(1)(a) (' \n\t       use in providing treatment services to the person giving consent and another specified person together' ) and 2(1)(b) (' use in providing treatment services to persons not including the person giving consent ') of Schedule 3 to the 1990 Act. \n\t\t \n\t     (ii) \n\t\t \n\t\t   \n\t       \n\t\t The 1990 Act  does not state that a person must provide consent to that use being posthumous.

Whilst the absence of a placement may place the child at risk, the court must also take account of the fact that it is likely to be antithetic to a childÄôs best interests to be deprived of the protections of the statutory regulatory regime mandated by Parliament. Within this context, in the experience of this court, the providers that are unwilling to apply for registration of those offering placements that are the most problematic for vulnerable children in respect of which the court most regularly encounters a refusal to apply for registration, examples including holiday parks, private Air B&B properties, caravans and canal boats. These expose the child to a double deficit in the form of a sub-optimal placement that is also outwith the statutory regulatory regime designed to safeguard him or her. In such circumstances, for the court to acquiesce in the face of a refusal of a provider even to seek registration is to heighten significantly the risk to the highly vulnerable subject child. "

He says that Cow House was a property designed and built by Rebecca to her own taste as her ' \n\t   forever home '.  He adds that he has taken into account Mr Southgate's arguments as to the advantages of a clean break in which Rebecca receives a financial payment for her interest.  He accepts that it would minimise friction and avoid compelling people who have fallen out to live peaceably together, along with having tax advantages.  Nevertheless, at paragraph [168], he reaches the clear conclusion that Cow House should be transferred to Rebecca on discharge of the AMC loan.  He finds that transfer is the minimum award necessary to do justice  in the light of the proprietary estoppel she has established; the express promise made to her; and her contribution to its construction.  There were to be easements for the ancillary services such as access, drainage, gas tank and bio-digester.  He refused, however, to make a declaration preventing the opening of a commercial livery yard on the basis Rebecca was not entitled to such a declaration."

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 17 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   In those circumstances, it is appropriate for me to consider the substantive application for summary return.  Iran is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and this application is made under the court's inherent jurisdiction.  I have been referred to  \n\t   Re J (A Child)   [2005] UKHL 40 , in which Lady Hale of Richmond set out the following propositions.  She said: \n\t     \n\t   '24. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   This House, in the leading case of  \n\t     J v C  [170] AC 668, regarded it as clearly decided by  Re B's Settlement  and  McKee v McKee  that the existence of a foreign order would not oust the jurisdiction or preclude the operation of the welfare principle.  This applies  a fortiori  where the foreign court would have had jurisdiction to make an order but has not done so, so that no question of comity arises ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   25. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Hence, in all non-Convention cases, the courts have consistently held that they must act in accordance with the welfare of the individual child.  If they do decide to return the child, that is because it is in his best interests to do so, not because the welfare principle has been superseded by some other consideration.  This was so, even in those cases decided around the time that the Hague Convention was being implemented here, where it was held that the courts should take account of its philosophyï¿½Ä¶  The Court of Appeal, in  \n\t     Re P (A Minor) (Child Abduction: Non Convention County)   [1997] Fam 45  has held that the Hague Convention concepts are not to be applied in a non-Convention case.  Hence, the first two propositions set out by Mr Justice Hughes in the case were entirely correct: the child's welfare is paramount and the specialist rules and concepts of the Hague Convention are not to be applied by analogy in a non-Convention case. \n\t     \n\t   26. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Thirdly, however, the court does have power, in accordance with the welfare principle, to order the immediate return of a child to a foreign jurisdiction without conducting a full investigation of the merits.  In a series of cases during the 1960s, these came to be known as 'kidnapping' cases.  The principles were summed up by Lord Justice Buckley in  \n\t     Re L (Minors) (Wardship: Jurisdiction)   [1974] 1 WLR 250 , at p.264, rightly described by Lord Justice Ward in  Re P  and  Reï¿½ï¿½JA  as the  locus classicus: \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     'To take a child from his native land, to remove him to another country where, maybe, his native tongue is not spoken, to divorce him from the social customs and contacts to which he has been accustomed, to interrupt his education in his native land and subject him to a foreign system of education, are all acts (offered here as examples and of course not as a complete catalogue of possible relevant factors) which are likely to be psychologically disturbing to the child, particularly at a time when his family life is also disrupted. If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible.  A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this.  The judge may well be persuaded that it would be better for the child that those merits should be investigated in a court in his native country.' \n\t       \n\t     \n\t   27. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     He went on to emphasise that in doing so, the court was not punishing the parent for her conduct, but applying the cardinal rule. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   28. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     It is plain, therefore, that there is always a choice to be made.  Summary return should not be the automatic reaction to any and every unauthorised taking or keeping of a child from his home country.  On the other hand, summary return may very well be in the best interests of the individual child. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       Making the choice \n\t     \n\t   29. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     How then is the trial judge to set about making that choice?  His focus has to be on the individual child in the particular circumstances of the case.  The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  A fortiori, the hope that countries which have not yet become parties to such treaties might be encouraged to do so in future is irrelevant.  There may be good reasons why those countries are unable to join the club.  They may well believe that it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of their laws to accept the reciprocity entailed. \n\t      As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, pointed out in the course of the argument, they may have no incentive to join if their children are returned to them without their having to return other children to a system which is so completely different from their own.  This is all pure speculation and has nothing to do with the welfare of the little boy whose future has to be decided in this case. \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t       \n\t     \n\t   32. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   ï¿½Ä¶the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there.  A case against his doing so has to be made.  But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case.  What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.  It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   33. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   One important variable, as indicated in  \n\t     Re L , is the degree of connection of the child with each country.  This is not to apply what has become the technical concept of habitual residence, but to ask in a common sense way with which country the child has the closer connection.  What is his 'home' country?  Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far will all come into this. \n\t     \n\t   34. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Another closely related factor will be the length of time he has spent in each country.  Uprooting a child from one environment and bringing him to a completely unfamiliar one, especially if this has been done clandestinely, may well not be in his best interests.  A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle.  But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer term future is decided than it would be to return. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t       \n\t     \n\t 38. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Hence, our law does not start from any  \n\t     a priori  assumptions about what is best for any individual child.  It looks at the child and weighs a number of factors in the balance, now set out in the well-known 'check-list' in  section 1(3)  of the  Children Act 1989 ; these include his own wishes and feelings, his physical, emotional and educational needs and the relative capacities of the adults around him to meet those needs, the effect of change, his own characteristics and background, including his ethnicity, culture and religion, and any harm he has suffered or risks suffering in the future.  There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future.  Our own society is a multi-cultural one, but looking at it from the child's point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the different cultures within his own family.'"

This form is relevant as it is being done in the context of a future surrogacy as Plan B. Section 2 of the WSG form specifically states the name of the surrogate can be given if known at the time of consent. Section 6.4 of the WSG form under the sub-heading of  \n\t   'In the event of your death or mental capacity'  asks  'Do you consent to embryos (already created outside the body using your eggs) being transferred to the surrogate?'.  The WSG form is not limited to the circumstances in the event of death but is fit for purpose in a situation where consent is being given prior to death."

(6A) A woman shall not be provided with treatment services after the happening of any event falling within any paragraph of Part 2 of Schedule 3ZA unless (before or after the event) she and the intended second parent have been given a suitable opportunity to receive proper counselling about the implications of the woman being provided with treatment services after the happening of that event, and have been provided with such relevant information as is proper. (6B) The reference in subsection (6A) to the intended second parent is a reference to' (a) any man as respects whom the agreed fatherhood conditions in section 37 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 (' the 2008 Act ') are for the time being satisfied in relation to treatment provided to the woman mentioned in subsection (6A), and (b) any woman as respects whom the agreed female parenthood conditions in section 44 of the 2008 Act are for the time being satisfied in relation to treatment provided to the woman mentioned in subsection (6A).

She relies upon a number of matters to support that position, namely: (i) The written consent Ms Choya provided to the use of the embryos in treatment services to her and Mr Jennings in accordance with Schedule 3 paragraph 2 (1)(a) of  \n\t   the 1990 Act . It was not withdrawn and is not automatically revoked on Ms Choya's death. (ii) Ms Choya completed the WT form for Mr Jennings, ticking the box to record his consent to the embryos being used in Ms Choya's treatment in the event of his death. Ms Richards submits this demonstrates Ms Choya contemplated use of the embryos in the event of one of their deaths. (iii) The evidence that Ms Choya wanted the embryo to be used in treatment with a surrogate in the event their fourth cycle was unsuccessful. This had been discussed between Mr Jennings and Ms Choya, discussed in general terms with Dr Seshadri and discussed with the wider family (which is supported by their statements) and they resolved that if the fourth treatment was unsuccessful they would use the single embryo remaining in storage in treatment with a surrogate."

But, and this is a key message, whatever the positive obligations of a local authority under Article 5 may be, they do not clothe it with any power to regulate, control, compel, restrain, confine or coerce. A local authority which seeks to do so must either point to specific statutory authority for what it is doing ' and, as I have pointed out, such statutory powers are, by and large, lacking in cases such as this ' or obtain the appropriate sanction of the court.

(2) The applicants must be' (a) husband and wife, (b) civil partners of each other, or (c) two persons who are living as partners in an enduring family relationship and are not within prohibited degrees of relationship in relation to each other. (3) Except in a case falling within subsection (11), the applicants must apply for the order during the period of 6 months beginning with the day on which the child is born. (4) At the time of the application and the making of the order' (a) the child's home must be with the applicants, and (b) either or both of the applicants must be domiciled in the United Kingdom or in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. (5) At the time of the making of the order both the applicants must have attained the age of 18. (6) The court must be satisfied that both' (a) the woman who carried the child, and (b) any other person who is a parent of the child but is not one of the applicants (including any man who is the father by virtue of section 35 or 36 or any woman who is a parent by virtue of section 42 or 43), have freely, and with full understanding of what is involved, agreed unconditionally to the making of the order. (7) Subsection (6) does not require the agreement of a person who cannot be found or is incapable of giving agreement; and the agreement of the woman who carried the child is ineffective for the purpose of that subsection if given by her less than six weeks after the child's birth. (8) The court must be satisfied that no money or other benefit (other than for expenses reasonably incurred) has been given or received by either of the applicants for or in consideration of' (a) the making of the order, (b) any agreement required by subsection (6), (c) the handing over of the child to the applicants, or (d) the making of arrangements with a view to the making of the order, unless authorised by the court. (8A) An order relating to the child must not previously have been made under this section or section 54A, unless the order has been quashed or an appeal against the order has been allowed. (9) For the purposes of an application under this section' (a) in relation to England and Wales ' (i) 'the court' means the High Court or the family court, and (ii) proceedings on the application are to be ' family proceedings ' for the purposes of the Children Act 1989, (b) in relation to Scotland, ' the court ' means the Court of Session or the sheriff court of the sheriffdom within which the child is, and (c) in relation to Northern Ireland, ' the court ' means the High Court or any county court ....

The suggestion in her skeleton argument that she should be joined as a party to B's sole application ' aside from her own application'  based on the welfare checklist in  s 1 (4)   ACA 2002  lacks any foundation, as does the assertion on her behalf that  'even if [A] is unsuccessful in obtaining a parental order, it does not necessarily follow that a parental order should be conferred on [B]'  which makes no sense in the light of her acknowledgment that he is a parent to Y. \n\t     \n\t   (2) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   How the intention of Parliament in the circumstances of this case meets the careful analysis required by the principles set out in in  \n\t     Ghaidin v Godin-Mendoza (ibid).

Following A becoming aware of  Y's conception in August 2022 A acted in a way, when she had the benefit of legal advice, that she did not consider herself to be y's parent, including in February 2023 when, with the benefit of legal advice, she recognised that B was Y's sole parent. In his submissions, Mr Harrison asserts the Article 8 position as follows, A and B  \n\t     'jointly chose to create a family together and elected to become co-parenting partners for life. That will remain the reality for the rest of the parties' lives and the decision reached in that regard, prior to the creation of both [X] and [Y's] embryos, cannot be erased so as to mean that they are not engaged in an enduring family relationship'.   As Ms Fottrell submits, even taking A's case at its highest, it is insufficient evidence of  'genuine personal ties'  with Y in circumstances where as long ago as August 2020 A recognised B could use the embryos to conceive another child, alone or with a partner, and since being made aware of T's conception in August 2022 until 13 March 2023 at no stage asserted she had the status of parent in relation to Y."

He said yes, but nevertheless I explained to him that it is a solemn promise to the court and has the equivalent power of an order of the court, but if the court were to find that he had deliberately broken an undertaking or deliberately failed to do something he had undertaken to do, the court has the power to fine him or to send him to prison, or both, and he fully understands that.  I made it clear to him that it would be a wholly exceptional case where the judge would send somebody to prison for not doing certain things that he promised to do but that the power is there.

The procedural formalities set out in FPR Rule 31.4(2) and Practice Direction 31A para 2.2 include providing a statement and a copy of the judgment translated into English. The court had the father's statement on 24 March 2023 and translated copies of the orders on 20 April 2023. If the court were to take the view that the application was procedurally irregular because no formal application had been received or the father's statement was unworn then what would happen is that there would be further delay whilst those matters were rectified. Such delay would not be in U's best interests neither would it be in the interest of either adult party. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   ii. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   There are two French orders before the court for the court's consideration - the July 2022 order and that of September 2022. The French appeal court simply refused the application to appeal the September 2022 order which therefore stands. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t iii. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Applying Moylan J (as he was) in  \n\t     Re P (Recognition and Registration of Orders under the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention)  , paragraphs 11 and 12 in particular, he submitted that: - [2014] EWHC 2845 (Fam) \n\t       \n\t     a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Recognition of the July 2022 order occurred by operation of law and there is no scope for challenge under Art 23 (2)(a)-(f) of the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention. Accordingly, under Art. 26 it is enforceable in this Jurisdiction. \n\t       \n\t       \n\t   b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     The order of September 2022 should be recognized unless refusal is justified on ground Art 23(2)(d) as argued on behalf of the mother. It is accepted on behalf of the child that there is no power in English and Welsh law to extinguish/terminate a mother's parental responsibility and therefore Art 23(d) would apply if the order of September 2022 terminated the mothers' parental responsibility. However, if the order simply restricted the exercise of her parental responsibility, then the order should be recognized and enforced. There is jurisdiction in this court to make a series of Prohibited Steps and Specific Issue orders which can restrict its exercise to the extent it is held if name only -  \n\t       H v A (No 1)  .

The undertakings offered by the father, in respect of which he is willing to submit to orders, are extensive and comprehensive in addressing the risks contended for by the mother. The Republic of Ireland is a signatory to the 1996 Hague Convention. Within that context, save in so far as they relate to issues of financial support and child maintenance, it would be open to the mother to seek to enforce undertakings or orders in the court in Ireland under Art 23 of the 1996 Convention as measures taken by the authorities of another contracting State. In addition, it would be open to the mother to obtain orders from the Irish court mirroring the protective measures obtained before this court. In circumstances where, as I have noted, the mother places her case regarding Art 13(b) squarely on the contention that the separation the mother from G by reason of her refusing to return to Ireland in the event the court made a return order constituted a grave risk of physical or psychological harm to G or would otherwise place him in an intolerable situation, which case I have rejected, I say no more about these matters.  \n\t  "

The function of the court, as recognised in  \n\t   Re T  at [23], is to determine issues that have arisen between the parties to litigation. The High Court is not a regulatory body and nor is it equipped to perform the role of one. It cannot, for example, deploy inspectors to inspect the placement in question nor does the court have the institutional expertise of an independent regulator. Whilst it can direct evidence from the local authority, that evidence will be from a party who has an interest in maintaining the placement in question. In short, the court is simply not in a position to replicate the scope and rigour of the regulatory regime that applies to registered placements. Parliament has further made clear that the task of regulatory oversight falls to an independent regulator and not to the court. As Lady Black noted in  Re T  at [44]:"

(3) For the purposes of this section an exclusion requirement is any one or more of the followingÄî (a) a provision requiring the relevant person to leave a dwelling-house in which he is living with the child, (b) a provision prohibiting the relevant person from entering a dwelling-house in which the child lives, and (c) a provision excluding the relevant person from a defined area in which a dwelling-house in which the child lives is situated. (4) The court may provide that the exclusion requirement is to have effect for a shorter period than the other provisions of the interim care order. (5) Where the court makes an interim care order containing an exclusion requirement, the court may attach a power of arrest to the exclusion requirement. (6) Where the court attaches a power of arrest to an exclusion requirement of an interim care order, it may provide that the power of arrest is to have effect for a shorter period than the exclusion requirement. (7) Any period specified for the purposes of subsection (4) or (6) may be extended by the court (on one or more occasions) on an application to vary or discharge the interim care order. (8) Where a power of arrest is attached to an exclusion requirement of an interim care order by virtue of subsection (5), a constable may arrest without warrant any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be in breach of the requirement. (9) Sections 47(7), (11) and (12) and 48 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Family Law Act 1996 shall have effect in relation to a person arrested under subsection (8) of this section as they have effect in relation to a person arrested under section 47(6) of that Act. (10) If, while an interim care order containing an exclusion requirement is in force, the local authority have removed the child from the dwelling-house from which the relevant person is excluded to other accommodation for a continuous period of more than 24 hours, the interim care order shall cease to have effect in so far as it imposes the exclusion requirement." ] ,

The procedural formalities set out in FPR Rule 31.4(2) and Practice Direction 31A para 2.2 include providing a statement and a copy of the judgment translated into English. The court had the father's statement on 24 March 2023 and translated copies of the orders on 20 April 2023. If the court were to take the view that the application was procedurally irregular because no formal application had been received or the father's statement was unworn then what would happen is that there would be further delay whilst those matters were rectified. Such delay would not be in U's best interests neither would it be in the interest of either adult party. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   ii. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   There are two French orders before the court for the court's consideration - the July 2022 order and that of September 2022. The French appeal court simply refused the application to appeal the September 2022 order which therefore stands. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t iii. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Applying Moylan J (as he was) in  \n\t     Re P (Recognition and Registration of Orders under the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention)  , paragraphs 11 and 12 in particular, he submitted that: - [2014] EWHC 2845 (Fam) \n\t       \n\t     a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Recognition of the July 2022 order occurred by operation of law and there is no scope for challenge under Art 23 (2)(a)-(f) of the 1996 Hague Child Protection Convention. Accordingly, under Art. 26 it is enforceable in this Jurisdiction. \n\t       \n\t       \n\t   b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     The order of September 2022 should be recognized unless refusal is justified on ground Art 23(2)(d) as argued on behalf of the mother. It is accepted on behalf of the child that there is no power in English and Welsh law to extinguish/terminate a mother's parental responsibility and therefore Art 23(d) would apply if the order of September 2022 terminated the mothers' parental responsibility. However, if the order simply restricted the exercise of her parental responsibility, then the order should be recognized and enforced. There is jurisdiction in this court to make a series of Prohibited Steps and Specific Issue orders which can restrict its exercise to the extent it is held if name only -  \n\t       H v A (No 1)  .

Those measures are not identical to  but very similar to those covered by Article 1(2) of Brussels IIA, which also covers guardianship, curatorship and similar institutions, designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's personal property, representing or assistance of the child and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care.  Both of them self-evidently also cover general matters of attribution, exercise, termination or restriction of parental responsibility.

Stephen was clear, when interviewed by a social worker on 9 August 2020, that his father had hit him. Peter admitted that he had not seen Stephen being hit, but that he had heard shouting and that Stephen had told him afterwards that his father had hit him. This account was consistent with what the children reported to their mother at the time and with what Stephen told the pre-trial judge and his grandmother and I find it more likely than not to be true.

They are perpetuating abusive and controlling behaviour to M, marginalising her and denying S his fundamental right to grow up with his mother.

I cannot know at this stage what the wife's recovery will be from any arrangement she is able to negotiate through the variation of the trust structure which I propose to make at the conclusion of these proceedings but I have confidence from the evidence before the court that it is likely to deliver value in excess of that which the husband is currently offering through his current lump sum proposal. It will be a matter for her as to how she structures her finances in terms of remitting those funds in a tax efficient manner but that is the inevitable result of the variation of the settlement which she seeks. From the foot of that outcome, she will have the financial security of knowing that she will be receiving ongoing income support for the next ten years.  During that period she will have ample time to develop her own earning capacity in order to meet her needs going forward and provide, in due course, for the time when she is no longer in paid employment.  The personal and financial circumstances of each of these parties may change as those ten years unfold but I am not in a position at this point in time to legislate prospectively for future events. It may be that the husband is in a position in due course to buy out any remaining income claims should his financial fortunes improve as I hope they might.  What I can determine at this stage is that the wife will have sufficient time over the next decade to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of that ongoing spousal support so as to justify prospectively a bar on her ability to extend that term. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     My decision"

At [38], in determining that the adoption order could be made notwithstanding the non-compliance, Keehan J held that: 'Parliament surely intended a 'sensible result'. To rule that the adoption application should not be permitted to proceed on the basis of this non-compliance with what appears to be a mandatory requirement would not be a 'sensible result'' I agree and adopt a similar approach in the circumstances attaching to the application in respect of Maya."

    "section_texts" : [ "1 Protection against forced marriage: England and Wales After Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 (c. 27) insert' Part 4A Forced marriage Forced marriage protection orders 63A Forced marriage protection orders (1) The court may make an order for the purposes of protecting' (a) a person from being forced into a marriage or from any attempt to be forced into a marriage; or (b) a person who has been forced into a marriage. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under this section and, if so, in what manner, the court must have regard to all the circumstances including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the person to be protected. (3) In ascertaining that person's well-being, the court must, in particular, have such regard to the person's wishes and feelings (so far as they are reasonably ascertainable) as the court considers appropriate in the light of the person's age and understanding. (4) For the purposes of this Part a person ('A') is forced into a marriage if another person ('B') forces A to enter into a marriage (whether with B or another person) without A's free and full consent. (5) For the purposes of subsection (4) it does not matter whether the conduct of B which forces A to enter into a marriage is directed against A, B or another person. (6) In this Part' ' force ' includes coerce by threats or other psychological means (and related expressions are to be read accordingly); and ' forced marriage protection order ' means an order under this section. 63B Contents of orders (1) A forced marriage protection order may contain' (a) such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements; and (b) such other terms; as the court considers appropriate for the purposes of the order. (2) The terms of such orders may, in particular, relate to' (a) conduct outside England and Wales as well as (or instead of) conduct within England and Wales; (b) respondents who are, or may become, involved in other respects as well as (or instead of) respondents who force or attempt to force, or may force or attempt to force, a person to enter into a marriage; (c) other persons who are, or may become, involved in other respects as well as respondents of any kind. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2) examples of involvement in other respects are' (a) aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, encouraging or assisting another person to force, or to attempt to force, a person to enter into a marriage; or (b) conspiring to force, or to attempt to force, a person to enter into a marriage. 63C Applications and other occasions for making orders (1) The court may make a forced marriage protection order' (a) on an application being made to it; or (b) without an application being made to it but in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (6). (2) An application may be made by' (a) the person who is to be protected by the order; or (b) a relevant third party. (3) An application may be made by any other person with the leave of the court. (4) In deciding whether to grant leave, the court must have regard to all the circumstances including' (a) the applicant's connection with the person to be protected; (b) the applicant's knowledge of the circumstances of the person to be protected; and (c) the wishes and feelings of the person to be protected so far as they are reasonably ascertainable and so far as the court considers it appropriate, in the light of the person's age and understanding, to have regard to them. (5) An application under this section may be made in other family proceedings or without any other family proceedings being instituted. (6) The circumstances in which the court may make an order without an application being made are where' (a) any other family proceedings are before the court ('the current proceedings'); (b) the court considers that a forced marriage protection order should be made to protect a person (whether or not a party to the current proceedings); and (c) a person who would be a respondent to any such proceedings for a forced marriage protection order is a party to the current proceedings. (7) In this section' ' family proceedings ' has the same meaning as in Part 4 (see section 63(1) and (2)) but also includes' (a) proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to adults; (b) proceedings in which the court has made an emergency protection order under section 44 of the Children Act 1989 (c. 41) which includes an exclusion requirement (as defined in section 44A(3) of that Act); and (c) proceedings in which the court has made an order under section 50 of the Act of 1989 (recovery of abducted children etc. ); and ' relevant third party ' means a person specified, or falling within a description of persons specified, by order of the Lord Chancellor. (8) An order of the Lord Chancellor under subsection (7) may, in particular, specify the Secretary of State. Further provision about orders 63D Ex parte orders: Part 4A (1) The court may, in any case where it considers that it is just and convenient to do so, make a forced marriage protection order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances including' (a) any risk of significant harm to the person to be protected or another person if the order is not made immediately; (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately; and (c) whether there is reason to believe that' (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service; and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the person to be protected or (if a different person) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about any order made by virtue of subsection (1). (4) The opportunity must be' (a) as soon as just and convenient; and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. 63E Undertakings instead of orders (1) The court may, subject to subsection (3), accept an undertaking from the respondent to proceedings for a forced marriage protection order if it has power to make such an order. (2) No power of arrest may be attached to an undertaking given under subsection (1). (3) The court may not accept an undertaking under subsection (1) instead of making an order if a power of arrest would otherwise have been attached to the order. (4) An undertaking given to the court under subsection (1) is enforceable as if the court had made the order in terms corresponding to those of the undertaking. (5) This section is without prejudice to the powers of the court apart from this section. 63F Duration of orders A forced marriage protection order may be made for a specified period or until varied or discharged. 63G Variation of orders and their discharge (1) The court may vary or discharge a forced marriage protection order on an application by' (a) any party to the proceedings for the order; (b) the person being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order); or (c) any person affected by the order. (2) In addition, the court may vary or discharge a forced marriage protection order made by virtue of section 63C(1)(b) even though no application under subsection (1) above has been made to the court. (3) Section 63D applies to a variation of a forced marriage protection order as it applies to the making of such an order. (4) Section 63E applies to proceedings for a variation of a forced marriage protection order as it applies to proceedings for the making of such an order. (5) Accordingly, references in sections 63D and 63E to making a forced marriage protection order are to be read for the purposes of subsections (3) and (4) above as references to varying such an order. (6) Subsection (7) applies if a power of arrest has been attached to provisions of a forced marriage protection order by virtue of section 63H. (7) The court may vary or discharge the order under this section so far as it confers a power of arrest (whether or not there is a variation or discharge of any other provision of the order). Arrest for breach of orders 63H Attachment of powers of arrest to orders (1) Subsection (2) applies if the court' (a) intends to make a forced marriage protection order otherwise than by virtue of section 63D; and (b) considers that the respondent has used or threatened violence against the person being protected or otherwise in connection with the matters being dealt with by the order. (2) The court must attach a power of arrest to one or more provisions of the order unless it considers that, in all the circumstances of the case, there will be adequate protection without such a power. (3) Subsection (4) applies if the court' (a) intends to make a forced marriage protection order by virtue of section 63D; and (b) considers that the respondent has used or threatened violence against the person being protected or otherwise in connection with the matters being dealt with by the order. (4) The court may attach a power of arrest to one or more provisions of the order if it considers that there is a risk of significant harm to a person, attributable to conduct of the respondent, if the power of arrest is not attached to the provisions immediately. (5) The court may provide for a power of arrest attached to any provisions of an order under subsection (4) to have effect for a shorter period than the other provisions of the order. (6) Any period specified for the purposes of subsection (5) may be extended by the court (on one or more occasions) on an application to vary or discharge the order. (7) In this section ' respondent ' includes any person who is not a respondent but to whom an order is directed. 63I Arrest under attached powers (1) Subsection (2) applies if a power of arrest is attached to provisions of a forced marriage protection order under section 63H. (2) A constable may arrest without warrant a person whom the constable has reasonable cause for suspecting to be in breach of any such provision or otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) A person arrested under subsection (2) must be brought before the relevant judge within the period of 24 hours beginning at the time of the person's arrest. (4) In calculating any period of 24 hours for the purposes of subsection (3), Christmas Day, Good Friday and any Sunday are to be ignored. 63J Arrest under warrant (1) Subsection (2) applies if the court has made a forced marriage protection order but' (a) no power of arrest is attached to any provision of the order under section 63H; (b) such a power is attached only to certain provisions of the order; or (c) such a power was attached for a shorter period than other provisions of the order and that period has expired. (2) An interested party may apply to the relevant judge for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person if the interested party considers that the person has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) The relevant judge must not issue a warrant on an application under subsection (2) unless' (a) the application is substantiated on oath; and (b) the relevant judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (4) In this section ' interested party ', in relation to a forced marriage protection order, means' (a) the person being protected by the order; (b) (if a different person) the person who applied for the order; or (c) any other person; but no application may be made under subsection (2) by a person falling within paragraph (c) without the leave of the relevant judge. 63K Remand: general (1) The court before which an arrested person is brought under section 63I(3) or by virtue of a warrant issued under section 63J may, if the matter is not then disposed of immediately, remand the person concerned. (2) Schedule 5 has effect in relation to the powers of the court to remand a person by virtue of this section but as if the following modifications were made to the Schedule. (3) The modifications are that' (a) in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 5, the reference to section 47 is to be read as a reference to this section; and (b) in paragraph 2(5)(b) of the Schedule, the reference to section 48(1) is to be read as a reference to section 63L(1). (4) Subsection (5) applies if a person remanded under this section is granted bail under Schedule 5 as modified above. (5) The person may be required by the relevant judge to comply, before release on bail or later, with such requirements as appear to the relevant judge to be necessary to secure that the person does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. 63L Remand: medical examination and report (1) Any power to remand a person under section 63K(1) may be exercised for the purpose of enabling a medical examination and report to be made if the relevant judge has reason to consider that a medical report will be required. (2) If such a power is so exercised, the adjournment must not be for more than 4 weeks at a time unless the relevant judge remands the accused in custody. (3) If the relevant judge remands the accused in custody, the adjournment must not be for more than 3 weeks at a time. (4) Subsection (5) applies if there is reason to suspect that a person who has been arrested' (a) under section 63I(2); or (b) under a warrant issued on an application made under section 63J(2); is suffering from mental illness or severe mental impairment. (5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (c. 20) (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Jurisdiction and procedure 63M Jurisdiction of courts: Part 4A (1) For the purposes of this Part ' the court ' means the High Court or a county court. (2) Subsection (1) is subject to any provision made by virtue of subsections (3) and (4). (3) Section 57(3) to (12) (allocation of proceedings to courts etc. ) apply for the purposes of this Part as they apply for the purposes of Part 4 but as if the following modification were made. (4) The modification is that section 57(8) is to be read as if there were substituted for it' (8) For the purposes of subsections (3), (4) and (5), there are two levels of court' (a) the High Court; and (b) any county court. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63O Contempt proceedings: Part 4A The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with a forced marriage protection order or otherwise in connection with such an order may be exercised by the relevant judge. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Supplementary 63Q Guidance (1) The Secretary of State may from time to time prepare and publish guidance to such descriptions of persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate about' (a) the effect of this Part or any provision of this Part; or (b) other matters relating to forced marriages. (2) A person exercising public functions to whom guidance is given under this section must have regard to it in the exercise of those functions. (3) Nothing in this section permits the Secretary of State to give guidance to any court or tribunal. 63R Other protection or assistance against forced marriage (1) This Part does not affect any other protection or assistance available to a person who' (a) is being, or may be, forced into a marriage or subjected to an attempt to be forced into a marriage; or (b) has been forced into a marriage. (2) In particular, it does not affect' (a) the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court; (b) any criminal liability; (c) any civil remedies under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (c. 40); (d) any right to an occupation order or a non-molestation order under Part 4 of this Act; (e) any protection or assistance under the Children Act 1989 (c. 41); (f) any claim in tort; or (g) the law of marriage. 63S Interpretation of Part 4A In this Part' 'the court' is to be read with section 63M; 'force' (and related expressions), in relation to a marriage, are to be read in accordance with section 63A(4) to (6); ' forced marriage protection order ' has the meaning given by section 63A(6); ' marriage ' means any religious or civil ceremony of marriage (whether or not legally binding); and ' the relevant judge ', in relation to any order under this Part, means' (a) where the order was made by the High Court, a judge of that court; and (b) where the order was made by a county court, a judge or district judge of that or any other county court." ] ,

Furthermore, in this case the court's orders include withholding the children's passports from the parents so that the family cannot travel abroad together as the father wishes to arrange. The children's mother appears to be living abroad so the consequences of the orders are particularly profound for the family. Accordingly, the orders in this case have a very important purpose and a very significant impact. \n\t  "

This clearly illustrates the clear intention behind the statutory scheme that has catered for the means by which different individuals with different relationships to the child can acquire parental responsibility which is commensurate with the values of the progressive and modern society we live in. As observed by Theis J,  the Act  itself does not define the term 'father'. In my judgment, the biological link is the foundation that identifies a man as the father of the child under the aforementioned statutory regime. When that foundation is displaced, the status of that man as the 'father' cannot persist. "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 35. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The leading case providing guidance on how to deal with applications under Part III is  \n\t   Agbaje v Agbaje  [2010] UKSC 13  where Lord Collins sets out the following, under the heading 'The proper approach': \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     To take up some of the points made in the preceding paragraphs, the proper approach to Part III simply depends on a careful application of sections 16, 17 and 18 in the light of the legislative purpose, which was the alleviation of the adverse consequences of no, or no adequate, financial provision being made by a foreign court in a situation where there were substantial connections with England. There are two, inter-related, duties of the court before making an order under Part III. The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: section 16(1). The second is to consider whether an order should be made under section 17 having regard to the matters in section 18. There are two reasons why the duties are inter-related. First, neither section 16(2) nor section 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account. Section 16(1) directs the court to have regard to \"all the circumstances of the case\" and section 16(2) refers the court to certain matters \"in particular.\" Second, some of the matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant under section 18, and vice versa. An obvious example would be that section 16(2)(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court. Plainly that would be relevant under section 18. So also the direction in section 18(6) to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party, \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     to have regard to whether an order of a foreign court has been complied with would plainly be relevant in considering whether England is the appropriate venue. \n\t     \n\t   72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It is not the purpose of Part III to allow a spouse (usually, in current conditions, the wife) with some English connections to make an application in England to take advantage of what may well be the more generous approach in England to financial provision, particularly in so-called big-money cases. There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country. In such cases mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III. Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered. Of course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust. \n\t     \n\t 73. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The amount of financial provision will depend on all the circumstances of the case and there is no rule that it should be the minimum amount required to overcome injustice. The following general principles should be applied. First, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage. This can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse. Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made. Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings. The full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court's case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case. This enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief."

When such material is withheld, how should the court manage hearings at which a Forced Marriage Protection Order is challenged? In this judgment I set out my reasons for sanctioning the appointment of a Special Advocate to represent the interests of the respondent father.

I am further satisfied that, with respect to the question of whether the interference could be said to be necessary in a democratic society and proportionate, that the strict application of the rule in  In re Valentine's Settlement  in this case does not constitute a sufficient reason for the purposes of Art 8(2) to justify that interference for the following reasons: \n\t     \n\t   i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   In circumstances where family life exists between KN and BN and TN and between TN and RN for the purposes of Art 8, the court cannot reasonably refuse to recognise the actual situation of TN viz-a viz KN and BN and RN and must engage with an examination of that actual situation.  As noted above, that actual situation is that KN and BN and the children have enjoyed a relationship since the children were eight weeks old.  KN and BN have the benefit of adoption orders in respect of the children in Nigeria and have treated them as their adoptive children since 2019.  KN and BN have identified themselves as 'mummy' and 'daddy' to the children from the outset and, as noted, the children know KN and BN as 'mummy' and 'daddy'. The children identify KN and BN as important figures within their family life, despite their geographical separation.  Further, TN and RN have lived as adoptive siblings in the same home since 20 May 2019.  They have during that time been treated as siblings by both KN and BN and BN's extended family.   They have benefited from each others physical and emotional company for an extended period and have shared the routines of daily family life, including online contact with KN and BN, for almost the entirety of there lives. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   In the foregoing context, a decision to refuse to recognise the adoption of TN in Nigeria would fail to take account of the social reality of the situation, which reality is that TN could not be fully integrated into her adopted family by means of the creation of a permanent legal relationship in this jurisdiction.  TN would be left being the daughter of KN and BN in the jurisdiction of Nigeria but not in the jurisdiction of England and Wales, in which country her adoptive mother is a citizen. This would leave TN in the position of the so called 'limping infant' (see  \n\t     Re B(S)(An Infant)   [1968] Ch 204 )  As pointed out in  Re B(S)(An Infant)  the court cannot shut its eyes to the possibility of creating a limping adoption, one of the consequences of which would be that TN would have no legal right of succession in this jurisdiction in relation to the property of their mother notwithstanding she is their mother under Nigerian law. \n\t     \n\t   iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Further, and in similar context, TN would be left with the same legal relationship with her adoptive parents as RN in the jurisdiction of Nigeria, but with a different legal relationship to her parents to RN in the jurisdiction of England and Wales.  This would mean, for example, that RN would have preferential rights in this jurisdiction to those of his adoptive sister in relation to succession and inheritance in relation to the property of their parents. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The immigration consequences of any decision this court makes as to recognition is a matter  \n\t     entirely  for the Secretary of State for the Home Department and/or the First Tier Tribunal.  However, depending on the manner in which a decision by this court to recognise RN's Nigerian adoption but to refuse to recognise the Nigerian adoption of TN, on the grounds that the former satisfies the common law criteria for recognition but the latter does not, could result in the physical separation of the siblings between two jurisdictions were that decision to operate to permit the entry of RN into the United Kingdom but bar the entry of TN. \n\t     \n\t   v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Within the foregoing context, I am satisfied that according different legal statuses to RN and TN would also be likely to have an emotionally detrimental impact on TN were they to treated differently, as a result of a differential recognition of their status, in terms of their rights as children of KN and BN, and were they to be physically separated, as a result of their differing legal status in different jurisdictions. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   It is not possible in this case for KN and BN to adopt the children in this jurisdiction under the  \n\t     Adoption and Children Act 2002  as, for the reasons set out above and examined in further detail below in respect of KN, neither BN or KN are domiciled in a part of the British Islands for the purposes of  s.49  of the  Adoption and Children Act 2002 ."

In the circumstances, in cases of this nature the courts must be rigorous in ensuring the legal requirements in respect of consent under the foreign law in question have been strictly adhered to.  In this context, I agree with Mr Badejo that the affidavit of consent is a  \n\t   crucial  document given the clear requirement of the law that the court shall not make an adoption order unless parental consent has been obtained. It is therefore vital that any discrepancies in respect of the affidavit purporting to give consent are resolved to the satisfaction of the court.  Having regard to the evidence I have set out, it is not possible to conclude that they have been.  As Mr Badejo points out, KN and BN were not responsible for generating the document in which the inconsistency appears.  However, by reason of the matters set out above, the court is left with significant doubts regarding the evidence with respect to the consent of the woman identified as TN's birth mother.   Those doubts are sufficient in this case to lead me to the conclusion that I cannot be satisfied that TN's adoption was concluded in accordance with the requirements of Nigerian law."

Re R (Disclosure)  [1998] 1 FLR 433 concerned an application by the father's employer, the Probation Service, for disclosure of a psychiatric report which opined that the father might pose a risk to children. In allowing disclosure of this report, Kirkwood J explained the purpose of the application, namely: \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'At the core of the application is the obvious point that, as a probation officer, Mr R has to have close, balanced and responsible dealings with families and people of all ages. It is the chief probation officer's duty to ensure that the probation officers within his area of responsibility are suitable people to do that work. It is plainly and strongly indeed in the public interest that he carries out that responsibility and that an unsuitable person does not continue employment as a probation officer. Accordingly, it is undoubtedly, as I find, in the public interest that there be disclosure to him as Mr R's chief probation officer of the material that, as he knows, has given cause for concern' [435]"

It follows that as X should not be returned, nor should Y. It would not be right for this close sibling relationship to bend to the detriment of Y, to the policy demands of the Hague Convention. Indeed, as Professor George reminded me in his submissions, by promoting the voice of these children and concluding there is a grave risk of harm to Y, if  separated from his big sister, the court is giving effect to the policy imperative of the Hague Convention, which must apply, at times, in the exception to the rule that children are returned.

The common law test for recognition of a foreign adoption was considered by Sir James Munby in  \n\t   Re N (A Child)  [2016] EWHC 3085 (Fam), in which the President undertook a detailed review of relevant judgments starting from the decision of the Court of Appeal in  In re Valentine's Settlement, Valentine and others v Valentine and others  [1965] Ch 831 and concluding with the decision of this court in  QS v RS and T (No 3)  [2016] EWHC 2470 (Fam).  Within this context, the President confirmed the following four criteria for recognition: \n\t     \n\t   i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The adoptive parents must have been domiciled in the foreign country at the time of the foreign adoption. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The child must have been legally adopted in accordance with the requirements of the foreign law. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The foreign adoption must in substance have the same essential characteristics as an English adoption.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   There must be no reason in public policy for refusing recognition. \n\t    "

(1) When a court determines any question with respect toÄî (a) the upbringing of a child; or (b) the administration of a childÄôs property or the application of any income arising from it, the childÄôs welfare shall be the courtÄôs paramount consideration. (2) In any proceedings in which any question with respect to the upbringing of a child arises, the court shall have regard to the general principle that any delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child. (2A) A court, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (4)(a) or (7), is as respects each parent within subsection (6)(a) to presume, unless the contrary is shown, that involvement of that parent in the life of the child concerned will further the child's welfare. (2B) In subsection (2A) Äú involvement Äù means involvement of some kind, either direct or indirect, but not any particular division of a child's time. (3) In the circumstances mentioned in subsection (4), a court shall have regard in particular toÄî (a) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding); (b) his physical, emotional and educational needs; (c) the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances; (d) his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant; (e) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering; (f) how capable each of his parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs; (g) the range of powers available to the court under this Act in the proceedings in question.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 17 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   In those circumstances, it is appropriate for me to consider the substantive application for summary return.  Iran is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and this application is made under the court's inherent jurisdiction.  I have been referred to  \n\t   Re J (A Child)   [2005] UKHL 40 , in which Lady Hale of Richmond set out the following propositions.  She said: \n\t     \n\t   '24. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   This House, in the leading case of  \n\t     J v C  [170] AC 668, regarded it as clearly decided by  Re B's Settlement  and  McKee v McKee  that the existence of a foreign order would not oust the jurisdiction or preclude the operation of the welfare principle.  This applies  a fortiori  where the foreign court would have had jurisdiction to make an order but has not done so, so that no question of comity arises ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   25. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Hence, in all non-Convention cases, the courts have consistently held that they must act in accordance with the welfare of the individual child.  If they do decide to return the child, that is because it is in his best interests to do so, not because the welfare principle has been superseded by some other consideration.  This was so, even in those cases decided around the time that the Hague Convention was being implemented here, where it was held that the courts should take account of its philosophyï¿½Ä¶  The Court of Appeal, in  \n\t     Re P (A Minor) (Child Abduction: Non Convention County)   [1997] Fam 45  has held that the Hague Convention concepts are not to be applied in a non-Convention case.  Hence, the first two propositions set out by Mr Justice Hughes in the case were entirely correct: the child's welfare is paramount and the specialist rules and concepts of the Hague Convention are not to be applied by analogy in a non-Convention case. \n\t     \n\t   26. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Thirdly, however, the court does have power, in accordance with the welfare principle, to order the immediate return of a child to a foreign jurisdiction without conducting a full investigation of the merits.  In a series of cases during the 1960s, these came to be known as 'kidnapping' cases.  The principles were summed up by Lord Justice Buckley in  \n\t     Re L (Minors) (Wardship: Jurisdiction)   [1974] 1 WLR 250 , at p.264, rightly described by Lord Justice Ward in  Re P  and  Reï¿½ï¿½JA  as the  locus classicus: \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     'To take a child from his native land, to remove him to another country where, maybe, his native tongue is not spoken, to divorce him from the social customs and contacts to which he has been accustomed, to interrupt his education in his native land and subject him to a foreign system of education, are all acts (offered here as examples and of course not as a complete catalogue of possible relevant factors) which are likely to be psychologically disturbing to the child, particularly at a time when his family life is also disrupted. If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible.  A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this.  The judge may well be persuaded that it would be better for the child that those merits should be investigated in a court in his native country.' \n\t       \n\t     \n\t   27. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     He went on to emphasise that in doing so, the court was not punishing the parent for her conduct, but applying the cardinal rule. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   28. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     It is plain, therefore, that there is always a choice to be made.  Summary return should not be the automatic reaction to any and every unauthorised taking or keeping of a child from his home country.  On the other hand, summary return may very well be in the best interests of the individual child. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       Making the choice \n\t     \n\t   29. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     How then is the trial judge to set about making that choice?  His focus has to be on the individual child in the particular circumstances of the case.  The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  A fortiori, the hope that countries which have not yet become parties to such treaties might be encouraged to do so in future is irrelevant.  There may be good reasons why those countries are unable to join the club.  They may well believe that it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of their laws to accept the reciprocity entailed. \n\t      As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, pointed out in the course of the argument, they may have no incentive to join if their children are returned to them without their having to return other children to a system which is so completely different from their own.  This is all pure speculation and has nothing to do with the welfare of the little boy whose future has to be decided in this case. \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t       \n\t     \n\t   32. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   ï¿½Ä¶the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there.  A case against his doing so has to be made.  But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case.  What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.  It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   33. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   One important variable, as indicated in  \n\t     Re L , is the degree of connection of the child with each country.  This is not to apply what has become the technical concept of habitual residence, but to ask in a common sense way with which country the child has the closer connection.  What is his 'home' country?  Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far will all come into this. \n\t     \n\t   34. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Another closely related factor will be the length of time he has spent in each country.  Uprooting a child from one environment and bringing him to a completely unfamiliar one, especially if this has been done clandestinely, may well not be in his best interests.  A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle.  But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer term future is decided than it would be to return. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t       \n\t     \n\t 38. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Hence, our law does not start from any  \n\t     a priori  assumptions about what is best for any individual child.  It looks at the child and weighs a number of factors in the balance, now set out in the well-known 'check-list' in  section 1(3)  of the  Children Act 1989 ; these include his own wishes and feelings, his physical, emotional and educational needs and the relative capacities of the adults around him to meet those needs, the effect of change, his own characteristics and background, including his ethnicity, culture and religion, and any harm he has suffered or risks suffering in the future.  There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future.  Our own society is a multi-cultural one, but looking at it from the child's point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the different cultures within his own family.'"

(2) In that ScheduleÄî (a) Part 1 makes provision about powers of courts in England and Wales to make female genital mutilation protection orders; (b) Part 2 makes provision about powers of courts in Northern Ireland to make such orders. (2) After Schedule 1 to that Act (inserted by section 71(2) above) insertÄî SCHEDULE 2 Female genital mutilation protection orders PART 1 England and Wales Power to make FGM protection order 1 (1) The court in England and Wales may make an order (an ÄúFGM protection orderÄù) for the purposes ofÄî (a) protecting a girl against the commission of a genital mutilation offence, or (b) protecting a girl against whom any such offence has been committed. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under this paragraph and, if so, in what manner, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the girl to be protected. (3) An FGM protection order may containÄî (a) such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements, and (b) such other terms, as the court considers appropriate for the purposes of the order.

(6) An FGM protection order may be made for a specified period or until varied or discharged (see paragraph 6). Applications and other occasions for making orders 2 (1) The court may make an FGM protection orderÄî (a) on an application being made to it, or (b) without an application being made to it but in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (6). (2) An application may be made byÄî (a) the girl who is to be protected by the order, or (b) a relevant third party. (3) An application may be made by any other person with the leave of the court. (4) In deciding whether to grant leave, the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the applicant's connection with the girl to be protected; (b) the applicant's knowledge of the circumstances of the girl. (5) An application under this paragraph may be made in other family proceedings or without any other family proceedings being instituted. (6) The circumstances in which the court may make an order without an application being made are whereÄî (a) any other family proceedings are before the court (Äúthe current proceedingsÄù), (b) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not a party to the proceedings), and (c) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a party to the current proceedings. (7) In this paragraphÄî Äú family proceedings Äù has the same meaning as in Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 (see section 63(1) and (2) of that Act), but also includesÄî (a) proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to adults, (b) proceedings in which the court has made an emergency protection order under section 44 of the Children Act 1989 which includes an exclusion requirement (as defined in section 44A(3) of that Act), and (c) proceedings in which the court has made an order under section 50 of the Children Act 1989 (recovery of abducted children etc ); Äú relevant third party Äù means a person specified, or falling within a description of persons specified, by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor (and such regulations may, in particular, specify the Secretary of State). (8) Regulations under sub-paragraph (7) are to be made by statutory instrument, and any such instrument is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. Power to make order in criminal proceedings 3 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in England and Wales for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 4 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence. (2) In the case of an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 5(1), a person can be guilty of an offence under this paragraph only in respect of conduct engaged in at a time when the person was aware of the existence of the order. (3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct, the conduct is not punishable as a contempt of court. (4) A person cannot be convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct which has been punished as a contempt of court. (5) A person guilty of an offence under this paragraph is liableÄî (a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a fine, or both; (b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or a fine, or both.

(7) Äú Enactment Äù includes an enactment contained in subordinate legislation within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978. Ex parte orders 5 (1) The court may, in any case where it is just and convenient to do so, make an FGM protection order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under sub-paragraph (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the risk to the girl, or to another person, of becoming a victim of a genital mutilation offence if the order is not made immediately, (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately, and (c) whether there is reason to believe thatÄî (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service, and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the girl to be protected or (if different) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about an order made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1). (4) The opportunity must beÄî (a) as soon as just and convenient, and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. Variation and discharge of orders 6 (1) The court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order on an application byÄî (a) any party to the proceedings for the order, (b) the girl being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order), or (c) any person affected by the order. (2) In the case of an order made in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(a) to a party to the proceedings for the order is to be read as a reference to the prosecution and the defendant. (3) In addition, the court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 2(1)(b) or 3 even though no application under sub-paragraph (1) above has been made to the court. (4) Paragraph 5 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Arrest under warrant 7 (1) An interested party may apply to the relevant judge for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person if the interested party considers that the person has failed to comply with an FGM protection order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to such an order. (2) The relevant judge must not issue a warrant on an application under sub-paragraph (1) unlessÄî (a) the application is substantiated on oath, and (b) the relevant judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) In this paragraph Äú interested party Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) the girl being protected by the order, (b) (if a different person) the person who applied for the order, or (c) any other person; but no application may be made under sub-paragraph (1) by a person falling within paragraph (c) without leave of the relevant judge. Remand: general 8 (1) The court before which an arrested person is brought by virtue of a warrant under paragraph 7 may, if the matter is not then disposed of immediately, remand the person concerned. (2) Paragraphs 9 to 14 contain further provision about the powers of a court to remand under this paragraph. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies if a person remanded under this paragraph is granted bail under paragraphs 10 to 14. (4) The person may be required by the relevant judge to comply, before release on bail or later, with such requirements as appear to the judge to be necessary to secure that the person does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Remand: medical examination and report 9 (1) Any power to remand a person under paragraph 8(1) may be exercised for the purpose of enabling a medical examination and report to be made if the relevant judge has reason to consider that a medical report will be required. (2) If such a power is so exercised, the adjournment must not be for more than four weeks at a time unless the relevant judge remands the accused in custody. (3) If the relevant judge remands the accused in custody, the adjournment must not be for more than three weeks at a time. (4) Sub-paragraph (5) applies if there is reason to suspect that a person who has been arrested under a warrant issued on an application under paragraph 7(1) is suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. (5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Remand: further provision 10 (1) Where a court has power to remand a person under paragraph 8, the court may remand the person in custody or on bail. (2) If remanded in custody, the person is to be committed to custody to be brought before the courtÄî (a) at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at such earlier time as the court may require. (3) The court may remand a person on bailÄî (a) by taking from the person a recognizance (with or without sureties) conditioned as provided in paragraph 11, or (b) by fixing the amount of the recognizances with a view to their being taken subsequently in accordance with paragraph 14 and, in the meantime, committing the person to custody as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above. (4) Where a person is brought before the court after remand the court may further remand the person. (5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent. (2) If sub-paragraph (1)(a) applies, the person may be remanded for the period of the adjournment. (3) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody, the person may be committed to the custody of a constable if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days. 13 (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear before the court at the end of the period of remand, the court may further remand the person in his or her absence. (2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge. Other protection or assistance against female genital mutilation 16 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects any other protection or assistance available to a girl who is or may become the victim of a genital mutilation offence.

(2) Where the power to make an FGM protection order is exercisable by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, references in this Part of this Schedule to Äúthe courtÄù (other than in paragraph 2) are to be read as references to that court. (3) In paragraph (c)(i) of the definition of Äúrelevant judgeÄù in sub-paragraph (1), the reference to a judge of the court that made the order includes, in the case of criminal proceedings in a magistrates' court, a reference to a justice of the peace. PART 2 Northern Ireland Power to make FGM protection order 18 (1) The court in Northern Ireland may make an order (an ÄúFGM protection orderÄù) for the purposes ofÄî (a) protecting a girl against the commission of a genital mutilation offence, or (b) protecting a girl against whom any such offence has been committed.

(3) An FGM protection order may containÄî (a) such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements, and (b) such other terms, as the court considers appropriate for the purposes of the order. (4) The terms of an FGM protection order may, in particular, relate toÄî (a) conduct outside Northern Ireland as well as (or instead of) conduct within Northern Ireland; (b) respondents who are, or may become, involved in other respects as well as (or instead of) respondents who commit or attempt to commit, or may commit or attempt to commit, a genital mutilation offence against a girl; (c) other persons who are, or may become, involved in other respects as well as respondents of any kind.

Applications and other occasions for making orders 19 (1) The court may make an FGM protection orderÄî (a) on an application being made to it, or (b) without an application being made to it but in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (6). (2) An application may be made byÄî (a) the girl who is to be protected by the order, or (b) a relevant third party. (3) An application may be made by any other person with the leave of the court.

Power to make order in criminal proceedings 20 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 21 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence.

(3) If the court makes an order by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), it must specify a date for a full hearing. (4) In sub-paragraph (3), Äú full hearing Äù means a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. Variation and discharge of orders 23 (1) The court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order on an application byÄî (a) any party to the proceedings for the order, (b) the girl being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order), or (c) any person affected by the order. (2) In the case of an order made in criminal proceedings under paragraph 20, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(a) to a party to the proceedings for the order is to be read as a reference to the prosecution and the defendant. (3) In addition, the court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 19(1)(b) or 20 even though no application under sub-paragraph (1) above has been made to the court. (4) Paragraph 22 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly).

(4) Article 34(3) to (10) of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ( S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)) (allocation of proceedings to courts etc ) applies for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule as it applies for the purposes of that Order but as if the following modification were made. (5) The modification is that Article 34(8) is to be read as if there were substituted for itÄî (8) For the purposes of paragraphs (3), (4) and (5), there are two levels of courtÄî (a) the High Court; and (b) a county court.

(2) But an appeal does not lie to the High Court under sub-paragraph (1) where the county court is a divorce county court exercising jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 ( S.I. 1978/1045 (N.I. 15)) in the same proceedings. (3) Provision must be made by rules of court for an appeal to lie (upon a point of law, a question of fact or the admission or rejection of any evidence) to the Court of Appeal againstÄî (a) the making of any order under this Part of this Schedule, or (b) any refusal to make such an order, by a county court of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (2).

(8) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 28. Appeals: transfers and proposed transfers 28 (1) The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may, after consulting the Lord Chief Justice, by order make provision as to the circumstances in which appeals may be made against decisions taken by courts on questions arising in connection with the transfer, or proposed transfer, of proceedings by virtue of an order made under Article 34(5) of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ( S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)) as applied by paragraph 24(4) and (5) above.

(4) Section 41(3) of the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 (c. 33 (N.I.)) applies for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) in relation to the laying of a draft as it applies in relation to the laying of a statutory document under an enactment. Other protection or assistance against female genital mutilation 30 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects any other protection or assistance available to a girl who is or may become the victim of a genital mutilation offence. (2) In particular, it does not affectÄî (a) the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court; (b) any criminal liability; (c) any right to an occupation order or a non-molestation order under the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ( S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)); (d) any civil remedies under the Protection from Harassment (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 ( S.I. 1997/1180 (N.I. 9)); (e) any protection or assistance under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 ( S.I. 1995/755 (N.I. 2)); (f) any right to a forced marriage protection order under Schedule 1 to the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007; (g) any claim in tort.

F's need to dominate and control as a parent as has been demonstrated in his constant questioning of Z and his repeated dismissal of Z's own wishes and feelings and impose his own are but one side of the effective undermining of Z; this has extended to him ignoring her best interests when she has felt or been ill and insisting on her having a painful flu injection instead of the nasal spray recommended for her age group. The latter instance is of substantial concern as they relate to Z being allowed to make her own decision when it comes to her own body, added to which F's insistence that it was on religious grounds raises concerns about his ability to withstand similar conventional pressures in Guinea concerning FGM.  \n\t  "

Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses', Art.16.2 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Forced marriage is a form of domestic abuse and is a criminal offence. Forced Marriage Protection Orders perform an important role in protecting individuals, including children, who are threatened with forced marriage, for example by prohibiting a parent from taking their child out of the country. However, the source or nature of information that a person is threatened with forced marriage may itself require protection. There may be good grounds not to disclose that material to the child's parents or to others who are subject to restrictions imposed by a Forced Marriage Protection Order. When such material is withheld, how should the court manage hearings at which a Forced Marriage Protection Order is challenged? In this judgment I set out my reasons for sanctioning the appointment of a Special Advocate to represent the interests of the respondent father. Such appointments will be rare in the family justice system but they merit careful consideration in Forced Marriage Protection Order applications where the applicant relies on material that cannot be disclosed to a Respondent but the respondent challenges the justification for the order and applies to have it discharged.  \n\t  "

Stephen was clear, when interviewed by a social worker on 9 August 2020, that his father had hit him. Peter admitted that he had not seen Stephen being hit, but that he had heard shouting and that Stephen had told him afterwards that his father had hit him. This account was consistent with what the children reported to their mother at the time and with what Stephen told the pre-trial judge and his grandmother and I find it more likely than not to be true.

In making these observations, I am mindful of and very sympathetic to the huge pressures on judges dealing with the more difficult and sensitive family cases. These cases are often complicated by the fact that parents may be representing themselves and thus, when a significant legal issue arises, they are unable to draw the judge's attention to the relevant case law.

That after all is what M's 'alternative view' of the case is. The expression of that view, therefore, not only risks J's privacy but his emotional wellbeing. As will be clear from my extensive judgment, given space and independence, J has moved from presenting as a girl to asserting his male identity. This process has been gradual and public. It has been witnessed by his peers and teachers. His school has been tremendously supportive. This is the landscape in which J's Article 8 rights, asserted on his behalf by his father and Guardian, fall to be considered. There is, in my evaluation of the competing rights and interests here in play, a high and wholly unacceptable risk that the mother will either unknowingly or otherwise, broadcast some detail of her and J's life together which will identify J to those who know him and who hear or read such information. Again, the highly unusual facts of this case render that, self evidently, far more likely than would be the case in many other circumstances. The potential consequences incorporate not only the violation of J's privacy but the inestimable harm to him caused by hearing, or hearing of, his mother asserting, in the public domain, her wholly unjustified conviction that her son is gender dysphoric or identifies as a girl. Moreover, it is difficult to see how by advancing her views in the public domain M can fail to damage the fabric of her relationship with her son. That relationship as I have said in the substantive judgment is, above all else, J's right.'"

The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child's existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind.

The speech of Lord Nicholls, in particular, explained that  s 3  should not be given a narrow interpretation: \n\t     \n\t   '29. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ It is now generally accepted that the application of  section 3  does not depend upon the presence of ambiguity in the legislation being interpreted. Even if, construed according to the ordinary principles of interpretation, the meaning of the legislation admits of no doubt,  section 3  may nonetheless require the legislation to be given a different meaning ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   30. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     From this it follows that the interpretive obligation decreed by  section 3  is of an unusual and far-reaching character.  Section 3  may require a court to depart from the unambiguous meaning the legislation would otherwise bear. In the ordinary course the interpretation of legislation involves seeking the intention reasonably to be attributed to Parliament in using the language in question.  Section 3  may require the court to depart from this legislative intention, that is, depart from the intention of the Parliament which enacted the legislation. The question of difficulty is how far, and in what circumstances,  section 3  requires a court to depart from the intention of the enacting Parliament. The answer to this question depends upon the intention reasonably to be attributed to Parliament in enacting  section 3 . \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   32. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶  Section 3  enables language to be interpreted restrictively or expansively. But  section 3  goes further than this. It is also apt to require a court to read in words which change the meaning of the enacted legislation, so as to make it Convention-compliant. In other words, the intention of Parliament in enacting  section 3  was that, to an extent bounded only by what is 'possible', a court can modify the meaning, and hence the effect, of primary and secondary legislation .'  \n\t     \n\t 33. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Parliament, however, cannot have intended that in the discharge of this extended interpretative function the courts should adopt a meaning inconsistent with a fundamental feature of the legislation. That would be to cross the constitutional boundary  s 3  seeks to demarcate and preserve. Parliament has retained the right to enact legislation in terms which are not Convention-compliant. The meaning imported by application of  s 3  must be compatible with the underlying thrust of the legislation being construed. Words implied must, in the phrase of my noble and learned friend Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, 'go with the grain of the legislation'. ï¿½Ä¶ "

The question is by no means one which, consistently with the spirit of our jurisprudence, can be dealt with by the judge as resting in his mere discretion as to what is expedient. The latter must treat it as one of principle, and as turning, not on convenience, but on necessity.  \n\t       \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t     \n\t        ï¿½Ä¶. \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     He who maintains that by no other means than by such a [closed] hearing can justice be done ï¿½Ä¶ must make out his case strictly, and bring it up to the standard which the underlying principle requires. ï¿½Ä¶ he must satisfy the Court that by nothing short of the exclusion of the public can justice be done.' \n\t      "

(7) Subsection (6) does not require the agreement of a person who cannot be found or is incapable of giving agreement; and the agreement of the woman who carried the child is ineffective for the purpose of that subsection if given by her less than six weeks after the child's birth.

It is only when all reasonable steps have been taken to locate her without success that a court is likely to dispense with the need for valid consent.  Half-hearted or token attempts to find the surrogate will not be enough.  Furthermore, it will normally be prudent for the applicants to lay the ground for satisfying these requirements at an early stage.  Even where, as in this case, the applicants do not meet the surrogate, they should establish clear lines of communication with her, preferably not simply through one person or agency, and should ensure that the surrogate is made aware during the pregnancy that she will be required to give consent six weeks after the birth. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   'Secondly, although a consent given before the expiry of six weeks after birth is not valid for the purposes of  \n\t     section 54 , the court is entitled to take into account evidence that the woman did give consent at earlier times to giving up the baby.  The weight attached to such earlier consent is, however, likely to be limited.  The courts must be careful not to use such evidence to undermine the legal requirement that a consent is only valid if given after six weeks. \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   'Thirdly, in the light of the changes affected by the 2010 regulations, the child's welfare is now the paramount consideration when the court is 'coming to a decision' in relation to the making of a parental order.  Mr Ford submits, and I accept, that this includes decisions about whether to make an order without the consent of the woman who gave birth in circumstances in which she cannot be found or is incapable of giving consent.  It would, however, be wrong to utilise this provision as a means of avoiding the need to take all reasonable steps to attain the woman's consent.' \n\t    "

The use of a partner-created embryo pursuant to a surrogacy arrangement involves providing treatment services to both the commissioning parents and the surrogate. Therefore, consent for use of a partner-created embryo in treatment with a surrogate must specify both the purposes mentioned in paragraphs 2(1)(a) (' \n\t       use in providing treatment services to the person giving consent and another specified person together' ) and 2(1)(b) (' use in providing treatment services to persons not including the person giving consent ') of Schedule 3 to the 1990 Act. \n\t\t \n\t     (ii) \n\t\t \n\t\t   \n\t       \n\t\t The 1990 Act  does not state that a person must provide consent to that use being posthumous. This contrasts with the position in relation to the posthumous storage of embryos, which must state what is to be done with the embryo if the person who gave the consent dies or is unable, because the person lacks capacity to do so, to vary the terms of the consent or to withdraw it: paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3. \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   (d) \n\t     The individual providing consent must have been ' provided with such relevant information as is proper ' within the meaning of paragraph 3(1)(b) of Schedule 3 and must have been given a suitable opportunity to receive proper counselling about the implications of taking the proposed steps.   The 1990 Act  does not specify what information has to be given before a person's consent is effective or what ' proper counselling about the implications of taking the proposed steps ' involves. \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t     (e) The individual providing consent must specifically be informed of the \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     circumstances in which consent to the storage or use of an embryo may be varied or withdrawn \n\t       . \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   (f) The consent must not have been withdrawn.

My earlier decision is reported as  \n\t   Re N (a child) [2020] EWFC 35 . In it, I sought to explain, following the Supreme Court decision of  Re NY (A Child) [2019] UKSC 49 ,  [2019] 3 WLR 962 , that an application for a return order, whether outward or inward, should, save in exceptional circumstances, be formulated as an application for a specific issue order in the Family Court. At [9] I expressed the view that it was hard to envisage circumstances where it could be concluded that the Family Court did not have the necessary powers to make the substantive order sought. I therefore respectfully disagree with the view of the District Judge which I have set out at [11] above. The grant of a specific issue and prohibited steps orders is part of the routine diet of the Family Court. I have explained above at [10] how on 20 December 2020 the Family Court at Bromley made a prohibited steps order forbidding the mother from removing the two younger children from the jurisdiction. It would not have been much of a further step for the court to have gone on to have made an order requiring the mother to return B to the jurisdiction in circumstances where she was agreeing, at that time, to do so.

The measures covered by Article 1 include guardianship, curatorship and analogous institutions, the designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's person or property, representing or assisting the child, the placement of a child in foster care, family or institutional care, and the supervision by a public authority of the care of a child by any person having charge of them.  Those measures are not identical to  but very similar to those covered by Article 1(2) of Brussels IIA, which also covers guardianship, curatorship and similar institutions, designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's personal property, representing or assistance of the child and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care.  Both of them self-evidently also cover general matters of attribution, exercise, termination or restriction of parental responsibility.  So the subject matter of both the 1996 Convention and Brussels IIA are very similar and so I have no doubt that the 1996 Hague Convention applies to public law proceedings, in the same way that Brussels IIA did. \n\t  "

The mother relinquished the child for adoption and she was adopted in El Salvador by an English couple. The adoption was not recognised under English law. Again, there was no doubt that the mother consented to an adoption order being made in El Salvador. However, by way of contrast with the situation in  Re G , the prospect of a foreign adoption order had there been canvassed with the mother. As Johnson J explained: ' A member of the embassy staff had visited the mother in November 1993. In reporting the result of that visit, the ambassador wrote: 'I explained to the mother the implications of adoption overseas and that she would no longer have any rights to the child. She said she understood and accepted this.' I hold, on the basis of that information from the ambassador, that this mother was aware that there would be an adoption application in England, that the applicants would be applying for 'an adoption order' and that (in the words of the ambassador's letter) 'she understood and accepted this'' \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t    So it was that in those circumstances, the mother's consent to the adoption was valid.  \n\t    "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   My overall conclusions \n\t     \n\t   59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to my conclusions.  I am going to start by considering the various factors that I am directed by  \n\t     section 16(2)  of  the 1984 Act  to have particular regard to.  First, I will consider the connection which the parties to the marriage have to this jurisdiction.  I am clear that there is sufficient connection in this case for me to make a financial award in principle.  The parties had a home here.  Even though it was on a short-lease, the Husband demonstrated that he could extend that lease by doing so in 2016.  Valentin was educated here at Millfield and then at the European Business School in London.  At least initially, the medical procedures relating to his heart difficulties took place here.   The parties visited here regularly.  The Wife was very attached to this country and decided to make her life here when the marriage broke down.  Whether this was, originally, a tactical decision or not, I am satisfied that she does now intend to live here indefinitely.   \n\t     \n\t   60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Turning to their connection with Germany, it is, of course, the case that they are both German.  They were born there.  They lived there pretty constantly until the year 2000.  They married there.  They had a Pre-Marital Agreement there. Even after they left for Switzerland, they retained connections with Germany.  I gave examples in my previous judgment but, for these purposes, I will merely note the Wife's continuing attachment to her German hairdresser, Marianne and the long-standing role performed by Dr Maschmeier on behalf of the Husband.  Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the fact that they left Germany in 2000, primarily for tax reasons.  Such moves occur in so many of the financial remedy cases that I hear.  The super-rich do appear to consider that such moves have no adverse consequences whatsoever.  I do not agree.  When it comes to Part III applications, it is relevant to my consideration that Germany was abandoned as a place of residence twenty-two years ago.  It follows that I do not consider the German links to be so strong as to prevent me from making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I must next consider their connection to Switzerland.  There is no doubt that the Husband lives there.  Valentin lives and works there as well.  The Husband's children by his first marriage also reside there.  I have not investigated just how deep the Husband's roots are in Switzerland.  I did, however, investigate those of the Wife in my previous judgment and I found that she did not integrate in that country; was deeply unhappy there; and could not wait to leave following the breakdown of the marriage.   Again, I am clear that the Swiss connection does not prevent me making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   62. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to the financial benefit that the Wife has received or is likely to receive outside this jurisdiction.  The answer is that, at least in the German divorce proceedings, she has received no benefit at all.  This is, of course, because she instructed her German lawyers to ensure her claims were dismissed.  The Husband says that this is equivalent to omitting to apply at all, which has to be considered under  \n\t     section 16(2) (f).  I must, therefore, consider whether she was justified in the stance that she took.  In this regard, I can come to reasonably clear conclusions.  I am satisfied that, pursuant to German law, the Wife would not have been awarded any capital provision at all.  This was because of a mixture of the Pre-Marital Agreement and the fact that there was no marital acquest.  I am satisfied that, even if she had succeeded in setting aside the Pre-Marital Agreement, it would have only been to enable her to receive maintenance.  Given the indication of Judge Block, on the balance of probabilities, I find that she would have done so, but not to obtain a capital award.  I am equally clear that the level of maintenance that she would then have received would have been modest.  At a maximum, she would have obtained an order equivalent to the sum the Husband was paying voluntarily but certainly not ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum or ï¿½Ç¨400,000 per annum.  To achieve a capital award, she would have had to change the law, as Mrs White did here.  I am clear that she was told by the Husband that he would contest this all the way and that it would take ten years, as she would have to go to the Federal Court in Germany, without any guarantee of a successful outcome.  I have no doubt he made this abundantly clear to her.  As it was said via his lawyers, it cannot be asserted that this was undue pressure but it was pressure and she succumbed.  I am clear that it was not unreasonable for her to do so.  Whether she was unreasonable not to conclude a deal with him in Germany, given that he was making offers far in excess of what she could have obtained in court, is an entirely different matter.  Fortunately, I do not need to answer it, given the existence of the May 2022 Dusseldorf Agreement.  It follows that I do not consider the fact that she asked the German Court to dismiss her claims to be fatal to her application here.   \n\t     \n\t   63. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst I have dealt with the provision she received in the German divorce proceedings, that does not cover any financial benefit which she has received or is likely to receive in Germany by virtue of an agreement.  In dealing with this, I do, of course, accept that she has repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  I have not heard expert evidence as to the law in Germany, but I consider it reasonable to assume that it will be the same as our contract law.  In other words, following the repudiation, she cannot change her mind and enforce the Agreement.  That does not mean that the Husband could not do so, but I consider it highly unlikely that he would attempt to do so now.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the provision agreed in Dusseldorf was something that she could have enforced on 23 May 2022, if she had gone down that route rather than repudiating the Agreement.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   64. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I therefore turn to consider the circumstances of the signing of the Agreement, applying the dicta in  \n\t     Edgar v Edgar .  I find that the Wife was extremely keen to conclude an agreement with the Husband.  I cannot see that he had nearly the same incentive as her.  I accept that Valentin was also keen to see if he could broker a settlement.  I am satisfied that the initial idea for the meeting came from the Wife.  She pressed for it.  She was willing to go both to Zurich and Dusseldorf to obtain an agreement.  She did so entirely willingly and without any pressure.  I find that she wanted to encourage the Husband to engage.  She knew that he did not want her lawyers involved, so she was happy to say that she would keep it secret from them.  I do not find she was pressurised to do so.  I do accept that Valentin's question about her wanting to tell her lawyers was designed to obtain a confirmation that she would not do so, but she agreed without being forced to do so.  In other words, it was not a condition of the meetings.  In fact, she eventually broke this promise by telling Mr Westley on 11 May 2022, although she did not do so at the consultation with Mr Chamberlayne on 9 May 2022.  I simply cannot speculate as to what happened when she told Mr Westley, other than to note that it did not prevent her going to Dusseldorf. It follows that I find that it was her choice to negotiate without Mr Westley or Mr Chamberlayne.  Whilst  Edgar  specifically refers to the lack of legal advice as being a potential reason for not enforcing such an agreement, I accept that the law has moved on since then and, in particular, following the decision of the Supreme Court in  Radmacher v Granatino   [2010] UKSC 42 .  The absence of legal advice is not fatal, if the unrepresented party has a proper appreciation of the Agreement reached.  I find that this Wife undoubtedly did have such a proper appreciation.  \n\t     \n\t   65. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I next turn to the second aspect, namely the asserted threats that she would get nothing if she did not sign the Dusseldorf Agreement.  The first point to make is that the Wife has, throughout, been aware of potential significant enforcement difficulties.  She had seen the three opinions which had been served further to the Husband's submissions opposing her application for permission to make this application.  She knew that it was one of the three reasons why it was said by him that I should not give leave.  I do not, of course, know what advice she received but it will not have been a surprise to her that this was relied on by both the Husband and Valentin.  I am satisfied that they did rely on it, but I am not satisfied that they took unfair advantage of this fact.  After all, the Husband was offering significant provision to the Wife.  If he had really intended to play hard-ball, I consider his offer would have been much lower than it was.  I am satisfied that the Wife was under pressure.  All litigants are under pressure as litigation is costly with no certainty of success.  I accept that she was under more pressure than the Husband who had very little to lose.  Nevertheless, on the balance of probabilities, I have come to the conclusion that the Wife was not under 'undue pressure' as described in  \n\t     Edgar .  In reaching this conclusion, I have been particularly influenced by her demeanour as described by both Valentin and Dr Maschmeier.  She was not some 'supplicant cowed into submission' by a bullying husband and son.  She was the driving force behind the meetings taking place at all.  She went not once but twice.  On the second occasion, she went notwithstanding having spoken to her lawyer about the first meeting.  I have accepted Dr Maschmeier's evidence as to what happened when he arrived.  She did not seem upset, disappointed or distressed at all.  The opposite was the case.  She was very relieved.  At the time, she considered the Agreement to be a good result.  She engaged entirely voluntarily with the champagne toast.  She was not desperate to leave.  Her comment about signing her death warrant was humorous and light-hearted.  It may have reflected some nagging doubts, but no more than that. She had reached an agreement with her Husband voluntarily and with her eyes open. I am fortified in this conclusion when I remind myself that I am also specifically directed to consider the extent to which any imposed order here would be likely to be enforceable.  Given that enforceability is an issue that I am required to consider, I find it difficult to see how I could say that raising the issue would be fatal to any subsequent agreement reached.   \n\t     \n\t   66. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do, however, take the view that I should consider the terms of the Agreement reached in the light of this Part III application.  I am clear that the provision set out in the Dusseldorf Agreement is very much within the bracket of possible awards that I might have made had there been no meetings in Zurich or Dusseldorf.  It follows that it certainly cannot be said that unfair or undue pressure caused the Wife to sign an Agreement that was unfair or outside the range of possible orders she could have got from the court.  I have already referred to my decision in  \n\t     MA v SK  in which I decided that the facts of that case meant that I should make an award that was 'needs light'.  I am clear that exactly the same sort of considerations apply here.  \n\t     \n\t   67. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If I had simply started with a blank sheet of paper, I am clear that I would have taken the view that a suitable London property for the Wife would have been Kinnerton Street.  If this had been an entirely English case, she would have received a considerably more valuable property, but it is not.  I cannot ignore the provision she would have got in Germany.  I would have taken the view that the freehold should be acquired or that the lease should be extended by thirty-five years as suggested by Mr Chamberlayne in his closing submissions.  I am equally clear that I would have considered it reasonable to refurbish/renovate the property and that the sum of ï¿½ï¿½800,000 to ï¿½ï¿½1 million would be appropriate.  The one likely departure from the Agreement is that I would have found that the property should be owned by the Wife, not by Valentin, but that is certainly not fatal.  There is always give and take in reaching an Agreement.  Provided the Wife has absolute security of occupation throughout her lifetime, there is no significant prejudice to her in the property being in the name of her son.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   68. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I would also have come to the conclusion that she should have a second home in the country.  In my judgment in the divorce proceedings, I mentioned this second home being in Germany but it is, of course, entirely up to the Wife where she has such a second home.  I am satisfied that, even allowing for the Part III considerations, a second home would be appropriate in a case where the parties had been married for 32 years and the Husband was worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.  I made such a finding in  \n\t     MA v SK  and I would have done so here.  The quantum of the provision, however, is a very different matter.  I would not have considered that the home should be the sort of home regularly occupied by multi-millionaires in the Home Counties.  I would have considered that a more modest property would be appropriate.  The capital award agreed was ï¿½Ç¨3 million.   At the current rate of exchange, this is just over ï¿½ï¿½2.5 million.  The Wife needs to discharge her liabilities in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½230,000.  She would therefore have just under ï¿½ï¿½2 million for a property, taking into account the costs of purchase.  I could not possibly say that this would be unreasonable given the Husband's property particular of Manor Farm House, Frilford, Oxon at a guide price of ï¿½ï¿½1.25 million.  I do accept that I do not know how much work would be required to that property but, in principle, the lump sum agreed would meet her 'needs light', even if she wanted to retain part of the money, previously described in our courts as a  Besterman  cushion.  I do, of course, accept that I would not have given the Husband a year to pay the second instalment but, as the price of obtaining enforceability, I consider this delay to be a small price to pay. \n\t     \n\t   69. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to maintenance. I accept that the standard of living was immensely high in this case.  Nevertheless, I could not have ignored the likely quantum of an order in Germany.  It would definitely have served to reduce downwards my award.  In Germany, the Husband had originally offered ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum whilst the Wife sought ï¿½ï¿½600,000 per annum.  I consider the agreed figure of ï¿½Ç¨480,000, which is currently equivalent to just over ï¿½ï¿½400,000 per annum, undoubtedly to be within the appropriate bracket.  I very much doubt my award would have been higher.  I suspect it might have been somewhat lower, given that I ordered ï¿½ï¿½225,000 per annum in  \n\t     MA v SK .   \n\t     \n\t   70. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do take the view that I would have been likely to capitalise the payment.  This would be in accordance with  \n\t     the Act  that requires me to have this as my objective.  It would be in accordance with the authorities.  After all, I capitalised the maintenance in  MA v SK .  Capitalisation is clearly possible in this case given that the Husband accepts he is worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.   I do not, however, consider that this likelihood would mean that I would never have made a periodical payments order.  I am required to consider the position in Germany and the extent of the enforceability of my award.  Suppose the Husband had attended in my court and told me that he wanted to be generous and would agree to an order in the sum of ï¿½Ç¨480,000 per annum, provided it was not capitalised.  I consider it at least possible that I would have agreed.  In any event, that is not the test.  The Agreement was a compromise. The Wife traded the probability of obtaining a capitalised lump sum from me and the possibility that she might enforce that order, for the certainty of generous monthly maintenance provision. I would not even hesitate in finding that such a decision was a reasonable one for her to adopt.   \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     By way of one final cross-check, I intend just to cover briefly the capital value of the Agreement if it had been ordered outright.  Before doing so, I remind myself that my award in  \n\t     MA v SK  was ï¿½ï¿½10 million in late 2014, which would equate to around ï¿½ï¿½12.75 million today.  The Dusseldorf Agreement would be worth a very similar sum, namely:- \n\t       \n\t     (a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Kinnerton Street (freehold/long leasehold) \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 \n\t       \n\t     (b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Works to Kinnerton Street \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½   900,000 \n\t       \n\t     (c) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Lump sum of ï¿½Ç¨3 million \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½2,500,000 \n\t       \n\t     (d) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Capitalised value of maintenance ( \n\t       Duxbury) ï¿½ï¿½4,750,000 \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Total \n\t                 ï¿½ï¿½12,250,000 \n\t     \n\t 72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   For me, the huge tragedy of this case is that the Wife repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  She clearly had 'buyer's remorse' but the risks of repudiation were extremely high.  I have already found it likely that the legal effect in Germany of repudiation would be to make the Agreement unenforceable.  The Husband, however, has made much of his wish to do the right thing by this Wife, to whom he was married for over thirty years and with whom he had his only son.  I decided in his favour in 2019.  In one sense, I have done so again by coming to the conclusion that the Dusseldorf Agreement should be enforced. I do so on the assumption and belief that he will now abide by the terms of the Agreement and the order that I intend to make. \n\t    "

Does the court need to assess the likelihood of noncompliance? Consider an application for a freezing injunction in respect of an asset overseas where the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the respondent. When considering whether to grant such an injunction the court will have in mind, perhaps at the forefront of its mind, whether the overseas court would reciprocally enforce the order if the respondent refused to comply with it. The court does not generally make an assessment, when making its decision, of the subjective intentions of the respondent as regards compliance with the order. Rather, the court is principally concerned with the question whether its order would be futile if the respondent breached it.  \n\t  "

This is a case of an admitted wrongful removal of an eight year old boy who has a sibling still living in Portugal. There is therefore a realistic possibility that changes may be made to the interim child arrangements orders and that the Portuguese court may make orders which would not prevent, or may even require, the return of F to Portugal. If so, this court could be well placed to act to act summarily under the 1980 Hague Convention to secure his return or to find that the defences under Art 13 are made out and exercise a discretion not to order return.  \n\t  "

Notwithstanding this position, the judge proceeded to make an order providing for no contact.  This deprived the father of the opportunity to present his evidence and argument with respect to the content of the Cafcass report, which the judge had repeatedly indicated during the course of the Dispute Resolution Hearing provided the evidential foundation on which he based the final order made.  In the circumstances, the father was deprived of the proper opportunity to comment on the key piece of evidence on which the court based its decision and to make submissions on the proper outcome of the proceedings more widely. In these circumstances, and considering the course of the Dispute Resolution Hearing as a whole, including the outcome of that hearing, I am satisfied that the process was not a fair one having regard to the demands of Art 6(1) of the ECHR.  I also conclude that, in circumstances where the Dispute Resolution Hearing would have led, and did lead, to measures of interference in the father's right to respect for private and family life, the approach adopted also contravened the procedural protections afforded by Art 8. \n\t  "

There is no need to do that here. We have a rule, and, just as Sir James Munby relied upon the same rule in  M v P , it seems to me that that is the proper course for this court to take. I, therefore, propose to grant the order that is sought, thereby rectifying the decree nisi and the decree absolute, so that they record the marriage that was being dissolved as being the Spanish marriage of 1993, and that is my judgment."

It was fundamentally important that the court should recognise the emotional harm which these girls had to suffer because of the poisoning of their relationship with him by Ms CW. This is what would otherwise be a classic case of parental alienation, but one that has been stretched out both temporally and geographically in litigation sprawling across two countries. That is illustrated by Ms CW's own position that, as is at D263 in the documents: 'The children neither need nor want their father in their lives.' This is a case, sadly, where the children call their father by his first name, and see no role for him in their future, and that is deeply damaging to them, and something the court should stop. The mechanism for doing that summary return, and for the court which is properly seised with the jurisdiction for making decisions about these children, because they were habitually resident here before their wrongful retention in Spain, to make the appropriate orders. This court is best placed to do so. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Ms CW submissions "

(2) A declaration may be made or an injunction granted under this subsection in any case where an application for judicial review, seeking that relief, has been made and the High Court considers that, having regard toÄî (a) the nature of the matters in respect of which relief may be granted by mandatory, prohibiting or quashing orders ; (b) the nature of the persons and bodies against whom relief may be granted by such orders; and (c) all the circumstances of the case, it would be just and convenient for the declaration to be made or the injunction to be granted, as the case may be. (2A) The High CourtÄî (a) must refuse to grant relief on an application for judicial review, and (b) may not make an award under subsection (4) on such an application, if it appears to the court to be highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would not have been substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred. (2B) The court may disregard the requirements in subsection (2A)(a) and (b) if it considers that it is appropriate to do so for reasons of exceptional public interest. (2C) If the court grants relief or makes an award in reliance on subsection (2B), the court must certify that the condition in subsection (2B) is satisfied. (3) No application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court; and the court shall not grant leave to make such an application unless it considers that the applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates. (3C) When considering whether to grant leave to make an application for judicial review, the High CourtÄî (a) may of its own motion consider whether the outcome for the applicant would have been substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred, and (b) must consider that question if the defendant asks it to do so. (3D) If, on considering that question, it appears to the High Court to be highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would not have been substantially different, the court must refuse to grant leave. (3E) The court may disregard the requirement in subsection (3D) if it considers that it is appropriate to do so for reasons of exceptional public interest.

(5) If, on an application for judicial review, the High Court makes a quashing order in respect of the decision to which the application relates, it may in additionÄî (a) remit the matter to the court, tribunal or authority which made the decision, with a direction to reconsider the matter and reach a decision in accordance with the findings of the High Court, or (b) substitute its own decision for the decision in question.

(5B) Unless the High Court otherwise directs, a decision substituted by it under subsection (5)(b) has effect as if it were a decision of the relevant court or tribunal. (6) Where the High Court considers that there has been undue delay in making an application for judicial review, the court may refuse to grantÄî (a) leave for the making of the application; or (b) any relief sought on the application, if it considers that the granting of the relief sought would be likely to cause substantial hardship to, or substantially prejudice the rights of, any person or would be detrimental to good administration.

Commonly this is found in contractual applications where the parties agree an exclusive jurisdiction for resolving disputes, but one party then brings a claim in a country other than the contractual forum. In noncontractual applications, examples include restraining a subsequent foreign action proceeding in parallel with an action established in the English courts: hence the source of the  \n\t   Hemain  injunction. The applicant must demonstrate that the bringing or continuing of those foreign proceedings is unconscionable (which can include oppressive or vexatious behaviour); an example is evidence of bad faith where the Respondent is exerting extreme pressure on the Applicant, as in  Cadre SA v Astra Asigurari SA  [2006] 1 Lloyds Rep 560 .

The fact that there may in the future be no longer any risk of assault, because an injunction has been granted, or that the opportunity for inter-marital or inter-partnership rape may no longer arise, does not mean that a pattern of coercive or controlling behaviour of that nature, adopted by one partner towards another, where this is proved, will not manifest itself in some other, albeit more subtle, manner so as to cause further harm or otherwise suborn the independence of the victim in the future and impact upon the welfare of the children of the family.'"

        "37 Powers of court in certain family proceedings. (1) Where, in any family proceedings in which a question arises with respect to the welfare of any child, it appears to the court that it may be appropriate for a care or supervision order to be made with respect to him, the court may direct the appropriate authority to undertake an investigation of the childÄôs circumstances. (2) Where the court gives a direction under this section the local authority concerned shall, when undertaking the investigation, consider whether they shouldÄî (a) apply for a care order or for a supervision order with respect to the child; (b) provide services or assistance for the child or his family; or (c) take any other action with respect to the child. (3) Where a local authority undertake an investigation under this section, and decide not to apply for a care order or supervision order with respect to the child concerned, they shall inform the court ofÄî (a) their reasons for so deciding; (b) any service or assistance which they have provided, or intend to provide, for the child and his family; and (c) any other action which they have taken, or propose to take, with respect to the child. (4) The information shall be given to the court before the end of the period of eight weeks beginning with the date of the direction, unless the court otherwise directs. (5) The local authority named in a direction under subsection (1) must beÄî (a) the authority in whose area the child is ordinarily resident; or (b) where the child is not ordinarily resident in the area of a local authority, the authority within whose area any circumstances arose in consequence of which the direction is being given. (6) If, on the conclusion of any investigation or review under this section, the authority decide not to apply for a care order or supervision order with respect to the childÄî (a) they shall consider whether it would be appropriate to review the case at a later date; and (b) if they decide that it would be, they shall determine the date on which that review is to begin." ,
        "25 Use of accommodation for restricting liberty. (1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, a child who is being looked after by a local authority in England or Wales may not be placed, and, if placed, may not be kept, in accommodation in England or Scotland provided for the purpose of restricting liberty (Äúsecure accommodationÄù) unless it appearsÄî (a) thatÄî (i) he has a history of absconding and is likely to abscond from any other description of accommodation; and (ii) if he absconds, he is likely to suffer significant harm; or (b) that if he is kept in any other description of accommodation he is likely to injure himself or other persons. (2) The Secretary of State may by regulationsÄî (a) specify a maximum periodÄî (i) beyond which a child may not be kept in secure accommodation in England or Scotland without the authority of the court; and (ii) for which the court may authorise a child to be kept in secure accommodation in England or Scotland ; (b) empower the court from time to time to authorise a child to be kept in secure accommodation in England or Scotland for such further period as the regulations may specify; and (c) provide that applications to the court under this section shall be made only by local authorities in England or Wales . (3) It shall be the duty of a court hearing an application under this section to determine whether any relevant criteria for keeping a child in secure accommodation are satisfied in his case. (4) If a court determines that any such criteria are satisfied, it shall make an order authorising the child to be kept in secure accommodation and specifying the maximum period for which he may be so kept. (5) On any adjournment of the hearing of an application under this section, a court may make an interim order permitting the child to be kept during the period of the adjournment in secure accommodation. (5A) Where a local authority in England or Wales are authorised under this section to keep a child in secure accommodation in Scotland, the person in charge of the accommodation may restrict the childÄôs liberty to the extent that the person considers appropriate, having regard to the terms of any order made by a court under this section. (6) No court shall exercise the powers conferred by this section in respect of a child who is not legally represented in that court unless, having been informed of his right to apply for the provision of representation under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and having had the opportunity to do so, he refused or failed to apply. (7) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide thatÄî (a) this section shall or shall not apply to any description of children specified in the regulations; (b) this section shall have effect in relation to children of a description specified in the regulations subject to such modifications as may be so specified; (c) such other provisions as may be so specified shall have effect for the purpose of determining whether a child of a description specified in the regulations may be placed or kept in secure accommodation in England or Scotland . (d) a child may only be placed in secure accommodation that is of a description specified in the regulations (and the description may in particular be framed by reference to whether the accommodation, or the person providing it, has been approved by the Secretary of State or the Scottish Ministers). (8) The giving of an authorisation under this section shall not prejudice any power of any court in England and Wales or Scotland to give directions relating to the child to whom the authorisation relates. (8A) Sections 168 and 169(1) to (4) of the ChildrenÄôs Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011 (asp 1) (enforcement and absconding) apply in relation to an order under subsection (4) above as they apply in relation to the orders mentioned in section 168(3) or 169(1)(a) of that Act. (9) This section is subject to section 20(8)."

In the absence of an applicable international instrument to facilitate the exchange of such information between jurisdictions, these methods will also include requesting information from the embassy, High Commission or consulate of the relevant foreign country, seeking information via non-government organisations that provide family tracing services, such as the Red Cross, and making enquiries of other known relatives (always taking care that such enquiries not place the parent in question in danger).

This is a problem which needs urgent attention by those responsible for the provision of resources in this area.\" \n\t      "

(2) The local authority must make arrangements for C to live with a person who falls within subsection (3) (but subject to subsection (4)). (3) A person (ÄúPÄù) falls within this subsection ifÄî (a) P is a parent of C; (b) P is not a parent of C but has parental responsibility for C; or (c) in a case where C is in the care of the local authority and there was a child arrangements order in force with respect to C immediately before the care order was made, P was a person named in the child arrangements order as a person with whom C was to live . (4) Subsection (2) does not require the local authority to make arrangements of the kind mentioned in that subsection if doing soÄî (a) would not be consistent with C's welfare; or (b) would not be reasonably practicable. (5) If the local authority are unable to make arrangements under subsection (2), they must place C in the placement which is, in their opinion, the most appropriate placement available. (6) In subsection (5) Äú placement Äù meansÄî (a) placement with an individual who is a relative, friend or other person connected with C and who is also a local authority foster parent; (b) placement with a local authority foster parent who does not fall within paragraph (a); (c) placement in a children's home in respect of which a person is registered under Part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000 or Part 1 of the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 2) ; or (d) subject to section 22D, placement in accordance with other arrangements which comply with any regulations made for the purposes of this section. (7) In determining the most appropriate placement for C, the local authority must, subject to subsection (9B) and the other provisions of this Part (in particular, to their duties under section 22)Äî (a) give preference to a placement falling within paragraph (a) of subsection (6) over placements falling within the other paragraphs of that subsection; (b) comply, so far as is reasonably practicable in all the circumstances of C's case, with the requirements of subsection (8); and (c) comply with subsection (9) unless that is not reasonably practicable. (8) The local authority must ensure that the placement is such thatÄî (a) it allows C to live near C's home; (b) it does not disrupt C's education or training; (c) if C has a sibling for whom the local authority are also providing accommodation, it enables C and the sibling to live together; (d) if C is disabled, the accommodation provided is suitable to C's particular needs. (9) The placement must be such that C is provided with accommodation within the local authority's area. (9A) Subsection (9B) applies (subject to subsection (9C)) where the local authority ...Äî (a) are considering adoption for C, or (b) are satisfied that C ought to be placed for adoption but are not authorised under section 19 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (placement with parental consent) or by virtue of section 21 of that Act (placement orders) to place C for adoption.

I recognise that Recorder Archer did not find all of M's allegations to be proved; nor did he find that there was a 'pattern' of behaviour by F such as to amount to 'controlling and coercive behaviour'.  I also recognise the Recorder found that M assaulted F on several occasions.   However, I consider the findings that were made against F to be highly significant and reject F's submission that these were 'minor'.  I set these out at ï¿½?14 above in some detail because, in my judgment, they demonstrate that F's conduct was highly disturbing, particularly the incident on 21 July 2017; that M was in such fear of F that she was extremely reluctant to tell police officers what had happened lest she get F in trouble, as this would 'make things worse'; and that she had good reason to be afraid of F.  Some of C's attitude to F is therefore understandable in the context of F's past abuse of M.  I do not consider that M 'psychologically manipulated' C by telling her the truth about F's past assaultive behaviour, even though this will undoubtedly have influenced C to view F negatively.  While it might have been preferable for M to keep the fact of F's domestic abuse from C, it is understandable how C may have come to learn about it at some point, whether from M herself or maternal family members, in the course of these proceedings and as she has sought explanations for why they could not return to Germany.   I note that there is no evidence that M has breached the prohibited steps order made by Recorder Kelly on 28 April 2022 prohibiting M from 'speaking negatively' about F, 'discussing the court proceedings' or 'discussing a move to Germany' with C.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (2). \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I am more troubled by C's understanding that F had also assaulted C, a view she expressed to Mr. Mammatah on 7 January 2022 and which, if it was said, could only have emanated from M or another maternal family member.   This allegation is not true, at least was not alleged at the fact-finding hearing.  However, I accept M's explanation to Mr. Mammatah that, if it was said, then C must have confused what she had been told or overheard.  I find it significant that C has not repeated this allegation to any of the other professionals who have worked with her intensively in the last year.  It is therefore unlikely to be a significant factor in C's opposition to F. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (3). \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The primary motivator for C's hostility to F is her perception that F is preventing her from returning to Germany.   This belief is genuinely held and is based, at least in part, on objective facts rather than a false narrative implanted by M.  It is objectively true that C and M were forced to return to the UK by the German Courts on F's application and that they have been prevented from returning ever since ' even for a holiday ' because of F's opposition.  The fact that F was, and is, within his rights in taking those steps because of M's unlawful actions in removing C in the first place and it is the courts, not F, that are preventing her from returning does not undermine the genuineness of her belief or mean it is 'not justified'.  C is of sufficient intelligence, age and maturity to understand there is a causal connection between her father's actions and her current situation.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t (4). \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   C's belief that F is the author of her misfortune is not the result of 'psychological manipulation' by C.  I accept M's evidence that, at least since the local authority became involved, she has sought to explain the proceedings to C by way of a 'script' developed with the social worker, SM, which makes clear that the decisions about her future are made by the judge ('wise owl') and not by F and M.  In any event, as the Guardian said in evidence, C may have learned of F's actions from a range of different sources: directly from M, indirectly through overheard conversations (as M maintains) or from other maternal family members; or from F himself, who has told C that he does not want her to live in Germany.  In oral evidence F accepted that he told C that she could go to Germany for holidays, but he wanted her to live in the UK.  In the event, F has opposed C even visiting Germany for a holiday. \n\t    "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   My overall conclusions \n\t     \n\t   59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to my conclusions.  I am going to start by considering the various factors that I am directed by  \n\t     section 16(2)  of  the 1984 Act  to have particular regard to.  First, I will consider the connection which the parties to the marriage have to this jurisdiction.  I am clear that there is sufficient connection in this case for me to make a financial award in principle.  The parties had a home here.  Even though it was on a short-lease, the Husband demonstrated that he could extend that lease by doing so in 2016.  Valentin was educated here at Millfield and then at the European Business School in London.  At least initially, the medical procedures relating to his heart difficulties took place here.   The parties visited here regularly.  The Wife was very attached to this country and decided to make her life here when the marriage broke down.  Whether this was, originally, a tactical decision or not, I am satisfied that she does now intend to live here indefinitely.   \n\t     \n\t   60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Turning to their connection with Germany, it is, of course, the case that they are both German.  They were born there.  They lived there pretty constantly until the year 2000.  They married there.  They had a Pre-Marital Agreement there. Even after they left for Switzerland, they retained connections with Germany.  I gave examples in my previous judgment but, for these purposes, I will merely note the Wife's continuing attachment to her German hairdresser, Marianne and the long-standing role performed by Dr Maschmeier on behalf of the Husband.  Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the fact that they left Germany in 2000, primarily for tax reasons.  Such moves occur in so many of the financial remedy cases that I hear.  The super-rich do appear to consider that such moves have no adverse consequences whatsoever.  I do not agree.  When it comes to Part III applications, it is relevant to my consideration that Germany was abandoned as a place of residence twenty-two years ago.  It follows that I do not consider the German links to be so strong as to prevent me from making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I must next consider their connection to Switzerland.  There is no doubt that the Husband lives there.  Valentin lives and works there as well.  The Husband's children by his first marriage also reside there.  I have not investigated just how deep the Husband's roots are in Switzerland.  I did, however, investigate those of the Wife in my previous judgment and I found that she did not integrate in that country; was deeply unhappy there; and could not wait to leave following the breakdown of the marriage.   Again, I am clear that the Swiss connection does not prevent me making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   62. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to the financial benefit that the Wife has received or is likely to receive outside this jurisdiction.  The answer is that, at least in the German divorce proceedings, she has received no benefit at all.  This is, of course, because she instructed her German lawyers to ensure her claims were dismissed.  The Husband says that this is equivalent to omitting to apply at all, which has to be considered under  \n\t     section 16(2) (f).  I must, therefore, consider whether she was justified in the stance that she took.  In this regard, I can come to reasonably clear conclusions.  I am satisfied that, pursuant to German law, the Wife would not have been awarded any capital provision at all.  This was because of a mixture of the Pre-Marital Agreement and the fact that there was no marital acquest.  I am satisfied that, even if she had succeeded in setting aside the Pre-Marital Agreement, it would have only been to enable her to receive maintenance.  Given the indication of Judge Block, on the balance of probabilities, I find that she would have done so, but not to obtain a capital award.  I am equally clear that the level of maintenance that she would then have received would have been modest.  At a maximum, she would have obtained an order equivalent to the sum the Husband was paying voluntarily but certainly not ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum or ï¿½Ç¨400,000 per annum.  To achieve a capital award, she would have had to change the law, as Mrs White did here.  I am clear that she was told by the Husband that he would contest this all the way and that it would take ten years, as she would have to go to the Federal Court in Germany, without any guarantee of a successful outcome.  I have no doubt he made this abundantly clear to her.  As it was said via his lawyers, it cannot be asserted that this was undue pressure but it was pressure and she succumbed.  I am clear that it was not unreasonable for her to do so.  Whether she was unreasonable not to conclude a deal with him in Germany, given that he was making offers far in excess of what she could have obtained in court, is an entirely different matter.  Fortunately, I do not need to answer it, given the existence of the May 2022 Dusseldorf Agreement.  It follows that I do not consider the fact that she asked the German Court to dismiss her claims to be fatal to her application here.   \n\t     \n\t   63. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst I have dealt with the provision she received in the German divorce proceedings, that does not cover any financial benefit which she has received or is likely to receive in Germany by virtue of an agreement.  In dealing with this, I do, of course, accept that she has repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  I have not heard expert evidence as to the law in Germany, but I consider it reasonable to assume that it will be the same as our contract law.  In other words, following the repudiation, she cannot change her mind and enforce the Agreement.  That does not mean that the Husband could not do so, but I consider it highly unlikely that he would attempt to do so now.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the provision agreed in Dusseldorf was something that she could have enforced on 23 May 2022, if she had gone down that route rather than repudiating the Agreement.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   64. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I therefore turn to consider the circumstances of the signing of the Agreement, applying the dicta in  \n\t     Edgar v Edgar .  I find that the Wife was extremely keen to conclude an agreement with the Husband.  I cannot see that he had nearly the same incentive as her.  I accept that Valentin was also keen to see if he could broker a settlement.  I am satisfied that the initial idea for the meeting came from the Wife.  She pressed for it.  She was willing to go both to Zurich and Dusseldorf to obtain an agreement.  She did so entirely willingly and without any pressure.  I find that she wanted to encourage the Husband to engage.  She knew that he did not want her lawyers involved, so she was happy to say that she would keep it secret from them.  I do not find she was pressurised to do so.  I do accept that Valentin's question about her wanting to tell her lawyers was designed to obtain a confirmation that she would not do so, but she agreed without being forced to do so.  In other words, it was not a condition of the meetings.  In fact, she eventually broke this promise by telling Mr Westley on 11 May 2022, although she did not do so at the consultation with Mr Chamberlayne on 9 May 2022.  I simply cannot speculate as to what happened when she told Mr Westley, other than to note that it did not prevent her going to Dusseldorf. It follows that I find that it was her choice to negotiate without Mr Westley or Mr Chamberlayne.  Whilst  Edgar  specifically refers to the lack of legal advice as being a potential reason for not enforcing such an agreement, I accept that the law has moved on since then and, in particular, following the decision of the Supreme Court in  Radmacher v Granatino   [2010] UKSC 42 .  The absence of legal advice is not fatal, if the unrepresented party has a proper appreciation of the Agreement reached.  I find that this Wife undoubtedly did have such a proper appreciation.  \n\t     \n\t   65. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I next turn to the second aspect, namely the asserted threats that she would get nothing if she did not sign the Dusseldorf Agreement.  The first point to make is that the Wife has, throughout, been aware of potential significant enforcement difficulties.  She had seen the three opinions which had been served further to the Husband's submissions opposing her application for permission to make this application.  She knew that it was one of the three reasons why it was said by him that I should not give leave.  I do not, of course, know what advice she received but it will not have been a surprise to her that this was relied on by both the Husband and Valentin.  I am satisfied that they did rely on it, but I am not satisfied that they took unfair advantage of this fact.  After all, the Husband was offering significant provision to the Wife.  If he had really intended to play hard-ball, I consider his offer would have been much lower than it was.  I am satisfied that the Wife was under pressure.  All litigants are under pressure as litigation is costly with no certainty of success.  I accept that she was under more pressure than the Husband who had very little to lose.  Nevertheless, on the balance of probabilities, I have come to the conclusion that the Wife was not under 'undue pressure' as described in  \n\t     Edgar .  In reaching this conclusion, I have been particularly influenced by her demeanour as described by both Valentin and Dr Maschmeier.  She was not some 'supplicant cowed into submission' by a bullying husband and son.  She was the driving force behind the meetings taking place at all.  She went not once but twice.  On the second occasion, she went notwithstanding having spoken to her lawyer about the first meeting.  I have accepted Dr Maschmeier's evidence as to what happened when he arrived.  She did not seem upset, disappointed or distressed at all.  The opposite was the case.  She was very relieved.  At the time, she considered the Agreement to be a good result.  She engaged entirely voluntarily with the champagne toast.  She was not desperate to leave.  Her comment about signing her death warrant was humorous and light-hearted.  It may have reflected some nagging doubts, but no more than that. She had reached an agreement with her Husband voluntarily and with her eyes open. I am fortified in this conclusion when I remind myself that I am also specifically directed to consider the extent to which any imposed order here would be likely to be enforceable.  Given that enforceability is an issue that I am required to consider, I find it difficult to see how I could say that raising the issue would be fatal to any subsequent agreement reached.   \n\t     \n\t   66. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do, however, take the view that I should consider the terms of the Agreement reached in the light of this Part III application.  I am clear that the provision set out in the Dusseldorf Agreement is very much within the bracket of possible awards that I might have made had there been no meetings in Zurich or Dusseldorf.  It follows that it certainly cannot be said that unfair or undue pressure caused the Wife to sign an Agreement that was unfair or outside the range of possible orders she could have got from the court.  I have already referred to my decision in  \n\t     MA v SK  in which I decided that the facts of that case meant that I should make an award that was 'needs light'.  I am clear that exactly the same sort of considerations apply here.  \n\t     \n\t   67. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If I had simply started with a blank sheet of paper, I am clear that I would have taken the view that a suitable London property for the Wife would have been Kinnerton Street.  If this had been an entirely English case, she would have received a considerably more valuable property, but it is not.  I cannot ignore the provision she would have got in Germany.  I would have taken the view that the freehold should be acquired or that the lease should be extended by thirty-five years as suggested by Mr Chamberlayne in his closing submissions.  I am equally clear that I would have considered it reasonable to refurbish/renovate the property and that the sum of ï¿½ï¿½800,000 to ï¿½ï¿½1 million would be appropriate.  The one likely departure from the Agreement is that I would have found that the property should be owned by the Wife, not by Valentin, but that is certainly not fatal.  There is always give and take in reaching an Agreement.  Provided the Wife has absolute security of occupation throughout her lifetime, there is no significant prejudice to her in the property being in the name of her son.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   68. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I would also have come to the conclusion that she should have a second home in the country.  In my judgment in the divorce proceedings, I mentioned this second home being in Germany but it is, of course, entirely up to the Wife where she has such a second home.  I am satisfied that, even allowing for the Part III considerations, a second home would be appropriate in a case where the parties had been married for 32 years and the Husband was worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.  I made such a finding in  \n\t     MA v SK  and I would have done so here.  The quantum of the provision, however, is a very different matter.  I would not have considered that the home should be the sort of home regularly occupied by multi-millionaires in the Home Counties.  I would have considered that a more modest property would be appropriate.  The capital award agreed was ï¿½Ç¨3 million.   At the current rate of exchange, this is just over ï¿½ï¿½2.5 million.  The Wife needs to discharge her liabilities in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½230,000.  She would therefore have just under ï¿½ï¿½2 million for a property, taking into account the costs of purchase.  I could not possibly say that this would be unreasonable given the Husband's property particular of Manor Farm House, Frilford, Oxon at a guide price of ï¿½ï¿½1.25 million.  I do accept that I do not know how much work would be required to that property but, in principle, the lump sum agreed would meet her 'needs light', even if she wanted to retain part of the money, previously described in our courts as a  Besterman  cushion.  I do, of course, accept that I would not have given the Husband a year to pay the second instalment but, as the price of obtaining enforceability, I consider this delay to be a small price to pay. \n\t     \n\t   69. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to maintenance. I accept that the standard of living was immensely high in this case.  Nevertheless, I could not have ignored the likely quantum of an order in Germany.  It would definitely have served to reduce downwards my award.  In Germany, the Husband had originally offered ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum whilst the Wife sought ï¿½ï¿½600,000 per annum.  I consider the agreed figure of ï¿½Ç¨480,000, which is currently equivalent to just over ï¿½ï¿½400,000 per annum, undoubtedly to be within the appropriate bracket.  I very much doubt my award would have been higher.  I suspect it might have been somewhat lower, given that I ordered ï¿½ï¿½225,000 per annum in  \n\t     MA v SK .   \n\t     \n\t   70. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do take the view that I would have been likely to capitalise the payment.  This would be in accordance with  \n\t     the Act  that requires me to have this as my objective.  It would be in accordance with the authorities.  After all, I capitalised the maintenance in  MA v SK .  Capitalisation is clearly possible in this case given that the Husband accepts he is worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.   I do not, however, consider that this likelihood would mean that I would never have made a periodical payments order.  I am required to consider the position in Germany and the extent of the enforceability of my award.  Suppose the Husband had attended in my court and told me that he wanted to be generous and would agree to an order in the sum of ï¿½Ç¨480,000 per annum, provided it was not capitalised.  I consider it at least possible that I would have agreed.  In any event, that is not the test.  The Agreement was a compromise. The Wife traded the probability of obtaining a capitalised lump sum from me and the possibility that she might enforce that order, for the certainty of generous monthly maintenance provision. I would not even hesitate in finding that such a decision was a reasonable one for her to adopt.   \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     By way of one final cross-check, I intend just to cover briefly the capital value of the Agreement if it had been ordered outright.  Before doing so, I remind myself that my award in  \n\t     MA v SK  was ï¿½ï¿½10 million in late 2014, which would equate to around ï¿½ï¿½12.75 million today.  The Dusseldorf Agreement would be worth a very similar sum, namely:- \n\t       \n\t     (a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Kinnerton Street (freehold/long leasehold) \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 \n\t       \n\t     (b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Works to Kinnerton Street \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½   900,000 \n\t       \n\t     (c) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Lump sum of ï¿½Ç¨3 million \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½2,500,000 \n\t       \n\t     (d) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Capitalised value of maintenance ( \n\t       Duxbury) ï¿½ï¿½4,750,000 \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Total \n\t                 ï¿½ï¿½12,250,000 \n\t     \n\t 72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   For me, the huge tragedy of this case is that the Wife repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  She clearly had 'buyer's remorse' but the risks of repudiation were extremely high.  I have already found it likely that the legal effect in Germany of repudiation would be to make the Agreement unenforceable.  The Husband, however, has made much of his wish to do the right thing by this Wife, to whom he was married for over thirty years and with whom he had his only son.  I decided in his favour in 2019.  In one sense, I have done so again by coming to the conclusion that the Dusseldorf Agreement should be enforced. I do so on the assumption and belief that he will now abide by the terms of the Agreement and the order that I intend to make. \n\t    "

(3B) In relation to an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(a) above, section 25(2)(c) above shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the breakdown of the marriage there were substituted a reference to the failure to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant, and in relation to an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above, section 25(2)(c) above (as it applies by virtue of section 25(3)(e) above) shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the breakdown of the marriage there were substituted a reference to the failure to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for the child of the family to whom the application relates. (5) Where on an application under this section it appears to the court that the applicant or any child of the family to whom the application relates is in immediate need of financial assistance, but it is not yet possible to determine what order, if any, should be made on the application, the court may make an interim order for maintenance, that is to say, an order requiring the respondent to make to the applicant until the determination of the application such periodical payments as the court thinks reasonable. (6) Where on an application under this section the applicant satisfies the court of any ground mentioned in subsection (1) above, the court may make any one or more of the following orders , that is to say' (a) an order that the respondent shall make to the applicant such periodical payments, for such term, as may be specified in the order; (b) an order that the respondent shall secure to the applicant, to the satisfaction of the court, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (c) an order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant such lump sum as may be so specified; (d) an order that the respondent shall make to such person as may be specified in the order for the benefit of the child to whom the application relates, or to that child, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (e) an order that the respondent shall secure to such person as may be so specified for the benefit of that child, or to that child, to the satisfaction of the court, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (f) an order that the respondent shall pay to such person as may be so specified for the benefit of that child, or to that child, such lump sum as may be so specified; subject, however, in the case of an order under paragraph (d), (e) or (f) above, to the restrictions imposed by section 29(1) and (3) below on the making of financial provision orders in favour of children who have attained the age of eighteen. (6A) An application for the variation under section 31 of this Act of a periodical payments order or secured periodical payments order made under this section in favour of a child may, if the child has attained the age of sixteen, be made by the child himself. (6B) Where a periodical payments order made in favour of a child under this section ceases to have effect on the date on which the child attains the age of sixteen or at any time after that date but before or on the date on which he attains the age of eighteen, then if, on an application made to the court for an order under this subsection, it appears to the court that' (a) the child is, will be or (if an order were made under this subsection) would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade, profession or vocation, whether or not he also is, will be or would be in gainful employment; or (b) there are special circumstances which justify the making of an order under this subsection, the court shall have power by order to revive the first mentioned order from such date as the court may specify, not being earlier than the date of the making of the application, and to exercise its power under section 31 of this Act in relation to any order so revived.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   The order I intend to make \n\t     \n\t   73. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Contrary to the submissions of Mr Marks on the Husband's behalf, I am clear that I should make an order.  I would have done so absent the Agreement.  As a result of the repudiation, it is likely that the Agreement is no longer enforceable in Germany.  Despite what I would characterise as the Wife's foolishness in repudiating it, I do not consider she should be in any worse position than if she had never been to either Zurich or Dusseldorf.  An agreement was reached and it should now be encapsulated in an order.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   74. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I have had to consider carefully how to do so to be entirely fair to both parties.  The lump sum is easy.  I order that the Husband pay the Wife ï¿½Ç¨1.5 million on 1 August 2022 and ï¿½Ç¨1.5 million on 1 August 2023.  The maintenance is also relatively straightforward.  I order that he pay her ï¿½Ç¨40,000 per month by way of secured provision from 1 August 2022 payable monthly in advance during her life-time or until further order.  I accept that there must be a remarriage clause.  The Husband is not domiciled in this jurisdiction.  Although the secured provision, in theory, means that the order survives his death, I entirely understand the Wife's concern as to this aspect.  It is clear to me that the Dusseldorf Agreement envisaged her being secure in the knowledge that she would receive this money even if the Husband were to die.  I require the Husband to make arrangements to ensure that the Wife will receive the money even after his death, if she survives him. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   75. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I very much hope that there will not be any difficulty in my order being complied with.  I do take the view that Valentin is likely to assist in ensuring that this is the case.  I do, however, have to guard against the possibility that it will not be.  I take the view that I can capitalise my order at any future stage if that becomes appropriate.  If the Husband were to fail to commence payment of the amount he agreed, I would be minded to capitalise the entire payment in the autumn of this year on application by the Wife.  If he were not able to put in place satisfactory proposals to ensure the Wife received her entitlement after his death, I would again be minded to capitalise the provision but I consider he should have a year from now to make those arrangements. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   76. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to the trickiest part, namely Kinnerton Street.  Again, I intend to abide by the Dusseldorf Agreement.  My order will be that the property is settled upon the Wife pursuant to  \n\t     section 24 (b) of  the 1973 Act  to ensure that she has the exclusive right of occupation of the property for the remainder of her life.  There will then be two deferred contingent lump sums.  The first will be in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 payable on 1 August 2024, index linked in accordance with the CPI, if the Husband, or Valentin, has not acquired the freehold or extended the lease on Kinnerton Street to one of at least fifty years by that date.  This corresponds with the Agreement, which makes provision for an alternative property if it is not possible to purchase the freehold or extend the leasehold.  I cannot see how it would not be possible to extend the lease as I believe that is a legal entitlement.  Nevertheless, if it has not been done, the lump sum becomes payable.  The Wife would then have to give up her right of occupation in Kinnerton Street on payment in full of the contingent lump sum.  The second deferred lump sum will be for the refurbishment works.  Again, the Husband will pay the Wife the sum of ï¿½ï¿½900,000 on 1 August 2024 if he or Valentin has not, by that date, expended at least ï¿½ï¿½800,000 on the provision of refurbishment works/improvement works to the property.   \n\t     \n\t   77. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   These parties have now been involved in bitter contested litigation for a number of years.  It is time it ended.  The parties wanted it to end when they met in Dusseldorf on 20 May 2022.  I now expect it to end on the terms of that Dusseldorf Agreement.  After all, both parties were content with it as a proper solution as recently as 20 May 2022.  They even toasted it with champagne.  I do believe that Valentin will do everything in his power to ensure it is now fully acted upon.  I am grateful to him for that.  It is vital to his mother's future and I very much want his relationship with her to be restored after this immensely damaging process.  I very much hope the Husband will see the sense in this as well.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t 78. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I want to pay tribute to all the assistance I have had with this difficult case.  Nothing more could have been said or done on behalf of either party. \n\t    "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   My overall conclusions \n\t     \n\t   59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to my conclusions.  I am going to start by considering the various factors that I am directed by  \n\t     section 16(2)  of  the 1984 Act  to have particular regard to.  First, I will consider the connection which the parties to the marriage have to this jurisdiction.  I am clear that there is sufficient connection in this case for me to make a financial award in principle.  The parties had a home here.  Even though it was on a short-lease, the Husband demonstrated that he could extend that lease by doing so in 2016.  Valentin was educated here at Millfield and then at the European Business School in London.  At least initially, the medical procedures relating to his heart difficulties took place here.   The parties visited here regularly.  The Wife was very attached to this country and decided to make her life here when the marriage broke down.  Whether this was, originally, a tactical decision or not, I am satisfied that she does now intend to live here indefinitely.   \n\t     \n\t   60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Turning to their connection with Germany, it is, of course, the case that they are both German.  They were born there.  They lived there pretty constantly until the year 2000.  They married there.  They had a Pre-Marital Agreement there. Even after they left for Switzerland, they retained connections with Germany.  I gave examples in my previous judgment but, for these purposes, I will merely note the Wife's continuing attachment to her German hairdresser, Marianne and the long-standing role performed by Dr Maschmeier on behalf of the Husband.  Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the fact that they left Germany in 2000, primarily for tax reasons.  Such moves occur in so many of the financial remedy cases that I hear.  The super-rich do appear to consider that such moves have no adverse consequences whatsoever.  I do not agree.  When it comes to Part III applications, it is relevant to my consideration that Germany was abandoned as a place of residence twenty-two years ago.  It follows that I do not consider the German links to be so strong as to prevent me from making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I must next consider their connection to Switzerland.  There is no doubt that the Husband lives there.  Valentin lives and works there as well.  The Husband's children by his first marriage also reside there.  I have not investigated just how deep the Husband's roots are in Switzerland.  I did, however, investigate those of the Wife in my previous judgment and I found that she did not integrate in that country; was deeply unhappy there; and could not wait to leave following the breakdown of the marriage.   Again, I am clear that the Swiss connection does not prevent me making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   62. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to the financial benefit that the Wife has received or is likely to receive outside this jurisdiction.  The answer is that, at least in the German divorce proceedings, she has received no benefit at all.  This is, of course, because she instructed her German lawyers to ensure her claims were dismissed.  The Husband says that this is equivalent to omitting to apply at all, which has to be considered under  \n\t     section 16(2) (f).  I must, therefore, consider whether she was justified in the stance that she took.  In this regard, I can come to reasonably clear conclusions.  I am satisfied that, pursuant to German law, the Wife would not have been awarded any capital provision at all.  This was because of a mixture of the Pre-Marital Agreement and the fact that there was no marital acquest.  I am satisfied that, even if she had succeeded in setting aside the Pre-Marital Agreement, it would have only been to enable her to receive maintenance.  Given the indication of Judge Block, on the balance of probabilities, I find that she would have done so, but not to obtain a capital award.  I am equally clear that the level of maintenance that she would then have received would have been modest.  At a maximum, she would have obtained an order equivalent to the sum the Husband was paying voluntarily but certainly not ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum or ï¿½Ç¨400,000 per annum.  To achieve a capital award, she would have had to change the law, as Mrs White did here.  I am clear that she was told by the Husband that he would contest this all the way and that it would take ten years, as she would have to go to the Federal Court in Germany, without any guarantee of a successful outcome.  I have no doubt he made this abundantly clear to her.  As it was said via his lawyers, it cannot be asserted that this was undue pressure but it was pressure and she succumbed.  I am clear that it was not unreasonable for her to do so.  Whether she was unreasonable not to conclude a deal with him in Germany, given that he was making offers far in excess of what she could have obtained in court, is an entirely different matter.  Fortunately, I do not need to answer it, given the existence of the May 2022 Dusseldorf Agreement.  It follows that I do not consider the fact that she asked the German Court to dismiss her claims to be fatal to her application here.   \n\t     \n\t   63. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst I have dealt with the provision she received in the German divorce proceedings, that does not cover any financial benefit which she has received or is likely to receive in Germany by virtue of an agreement.  In dealing with this, I do, of course, accept that she has repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  I have not heard expert evidence as to the law in Germany, but I consider it reasonable to assume that it will be the same as our contract law.  In other words, following the repudiation, she cannot change her mind and enforce the Agreement.  That does not mean that the Husband could not do so, but I consider it highly unlikely that he would attempt to do so now.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the provision agreed in Dusseldorf was something that she could have enforced on 23 May 2022, if she had gone down that route rather than repudiating the Agreement.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   64. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I therefore turn to consider the circumstances of the signing of the Agreement, applying the dicta in  \n\t     Edgar v Edgar .  I find that the Wife was extremely keen to conclude an agreement with the Husband.  I cannot see that he had nearly the same incentive as her.  I accept that Valentin was also keen to see if he could broker a settlement.  I am satisfied that the initial idea for the meeting came from the Wife.  She pressed for it.  She was willing to go both to Zurich and Dusseldorf to obtain an agreement.  She did so entirely willingly and without any pressure.  I find that she wanted to encourage the Husband to engage.  She knew that he did not want her lawyers involved, so she was happy to say that she would keep it secret from them.  I do not find she was pressurised to do so.  I do accept that Valentin's question about her wanting to tell her lawyers was designed to obtain a confirmation that she would not do so, but she agreed without being forced to do so.  In other words, it was not a condition of the meetings.  In fact, she eventually broke this promise by telling Mr Westley on 11 May 2022, although she did not do so at the consultation with Mr Chamberlayne on 9 May 2022.  I simply cannot speculate as to what happened when she told Mr Westley, other than to note that it did not prevent her going to Dusseldorf. It follows that I find that it was her choice to negotiate without Mr Westley or Mr Chamberlayne.  Whilst  Edgar  specifically refers to the lack of legal advice as being a potential reason for not enforcing such an agreement, I accept that the law has moved on since then and, in particular, following the decision of the Supreme Court in  Radmacher v Granatino   [2010] UKSC 42 .  The absence of legal advice is not fatal, if the unrepresented party has a proper appreciation of the Agreement reached.  I find that this Wife undoubtedly did have such a proper appreciation.  \n\t     \n\t   65. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I next turn to the second aspect, namely the asserted threats that she would get nothing if she did not sign the Dusseldorf Agreement.  The first point to make is that the Wife has, throughout, been aware of potential significant enforcement difficulties.  She had seen the three opinions which had been served further to the Husband's submissions opposing her application for permission to make this application.  She knew that it was one of the three reasons why it was said by him that I should not give leave.  I do not, of course, know what advice she received but it will not have been a surprise to her that this was relied on by both the Husband and Valentin.  I am satisfied that they did rely on it, but I am not satisfied that they took unfair advantage of this fact.  After all, the Husband was offering significant provision to the Wife.  If he had really intended to play hard-ball, I consider his offer would have been much lower than it was.  I am satisfied that the Wife was under pressure.  All litigants are under pressure as litigation is costly with no certainty of success.  I accept that she was under more pressure than the Husband who had very little to lose.  Nevertheless, on the balance of probabilities, I have come to the conclusion that the Wife was not under 'undue pressure' as described in  \n\t     Edgar .  In reaching this conclusion, I have been particularly influenced by her demeanour as described by both Valentin and Dr Maschmeier.  She was not some 'supplicant cowed into submission' by a bullying husband and son.  She was the driving force behind the meetings taking place at all.  She went not once but twice.  On the second occasion, she went notwithstanding having spoken to her lawyer about the first meeting.  I have accepted Dr Maschmeier's evidence as to what happened when he arrived.  She did not seem upset, disappointed or distressed at all.  The opposite was the case.  She was very relieved.  At the time, she considered the Agreement to be a good result.  She engaged entirely voluntarily with the champagne toast.  She was not desperate to leave.  Her comment about signing her death warrant was humorous and light-hearted.  It may have reflected some nagging doubts, but no more than that. She had reached an agreement with her Husband voluntarily and with her eyes open. I am fortified in this conclusion when I remind myself that I am also specifically directed to consider the extent to which any imposed order here would be likely to be enforceable.  Given that enforceability is an issue that I am required to consider, I find it difficult to see how I could say that raising the issue would be fatal to any subsequent agreement reached.   \n\t     \n\t   66. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do, however, take the view that I should consider the terms of the Agreement reached in the light of this Part III application.  I am clear that the provision set out in the Dusseldorf Agreement is very much within the bracket of possible awards that I might have made had there been no meetings in Zurich or Dusseldorf.  It follows that it certainly cannot be said that unfair or undue pressure caused the Wife to sign an Agreement that was unfair or outside the range of possible orders she could have got from the court.  I have already referred to my decision in  \n\t     MA v SK  in which I decided that the facts of that case meant that I should make an award that was 'needs light'.  I am clear that exactly the same sort of considerations apply here.  \n\t     \n\t   67. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If I had simply started with a blank sheet of paper, I am clear that I would have taken the view that a suitable London property for the Wife would have been Kinnerton Street.  If this had been an entirely English case, she would have received a considerably more valuable property, but it is not.  I cannot ignore the provision she would have got in Germany.  I would have taken the view that the freehold should be acquired or that the lease should be extended by thirty-five years as suggested by Mr Chamberlayne in his closing submissions.  I am equally clear that I would have considered it reasonable to refurbish/renovate the property and that the sum of ï¿½ï¿½800,000 to ï¿½ï¿½1 million would be appropriate.  The one likely departure from the Agreement is that I would have found that the property should be owned by the Wife, not by Valentin, but that is certainly not fatal.  There is always give and take in reaching an Agreement.  Provided the Wife has absolute security of occupation throughout her lifetime, there is no significant prejudice to her in the property being in the name of her son.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   68. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I would also have come to the conclusion that she should have a second home in the country.  In my judgment in the divorce proceedings, I mentioned this second home being in Germany but it is, of course, entirely up to the Wife where she has such a second home.  I am satisfied that, even allowing for the Part III considerations, a second home would be appropriate in a case where the parties had been married for 32 years and the Husband was worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.  I made such a finding in  \n\t     MA v SK  and I would have done so here.  The quantum of the provision, however, is a very different matter.  I would not have considered that the home should be the sort of home regularly occupied by multi-millionaires in the Home Counties.  I would have considered that a more modest property would be appropriate.  The capital award agreed was ï¿½Ç¨3 million.   At the current rate of exchange, this is just over ï¿½ï¿½2.5 million.  The Wife needs to discharge her liabilities in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½230,000.  She would therefore have just under ï¿½ï¿½2 million for a property, taking into account the costs of purchase.  I could not possibly say that this would be unreasonable given the Husband's property particular of Manor Farm House, Frilford, Oxon at a guide price of ï¿½ï¿½1.25 million.  I do accept that I do not know how much work would be required to that property but, in principle, the lump sum agreed would meet her 'needs light', even if she wanted to retain part of the money, previously described in our courts as a  Besterman  cushion.  I do, of course, accept that I would not have given the Husband a year to pay the second instalment but, as the price of obtaining enforceability, I consider this delay to be a small price to pay. \n\t     \n\t   69. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to maintenance. I accept that the standard of living was immensely high in this case.  Nevertheless, I could not have ignored the likely quantum of an order in Germany.  It would definitely have served to reduce downwards my award.  In Germany, the Husband had originally offered ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum whilst the Wife sought ï¿½ï¿½600,000 per annum.  I consider the agreed figure of ï¿½Ç¨480,000, which is currently equivalent to just over ï¿½ï¿½400,000 per annum, undoubtedly to be within the appropriate bracket.  I very much doubt my award would have been higher.  I suspect it might have been somewhat lower, given that I ordered ï¿½ï¿½225,000 per annum in  \n\t     MA v SK .   \n\t     \n\t   70. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do take the view that I would have been likely to capitalise the payment.  This would be in accordance with  \n\t     the Act  that requires me to have this as my objective.  It would be in accordance with the authorities.  After all, I capitalised the maintenance in  MA v SK .  Capitalisation is clearly possible in this case given that the Husband accepts he is worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.   I do not, however, consider that this likelihood would mean that I would never have made a periodical payments order.  I am required to consider the position in Germany and the extent of the enforceability of my award.  Suppose the Husband had attended in my court and told me that he wanted to be generous and would agree to an order in the sum of ï¿½Ç¨480,000 per annum, provided it was not capitalised.  I consider it at least possible that I would have agreed.  In any event, that is not the test.  The Agreement was a compromise. The Wife traded the probability of obtaining a capitalised lump sum from me and the possibility that she might enforce that order, for the certainty of generous monthly maintenance provision. I would not even hesitate in finding that such a decision was a reasonable one for her to adopt.   \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     By way of one final cross-check, I intend just to cover briefly the capital value of the Agreement if it had been ordered outright.  Before doing so, I remind myself that my award in  \n\t     MA v SK  was ï¿½ï¿½10 million in late 2014, which would equate to around ï¿½ï¿½12.75 million today.  The Dusseldorf Agreement would be worth a very similar sum, namely:- \n\t       \n\t     (a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Kinnerton Street (freehold/long leasehold) \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 \n\t       \n\t     (b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Works to Kinnerton Street \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½   900,000 \n\t       \n\t     (c) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Lump sum of ï¿½Ç¨3 million \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½2,500,000 \n\t       \n\t     (d) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Capitalised value of maintenance ( \n\t       Duxbury) ï¿½ï¿½4,750,000 \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Total \n\t                 ï¿½ï¿½12,250,000 \n\t     \n\t 72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   For me, the huge tragedy of this case is that the Wife repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  She clearly had 'buyer's remorse' but the risks of repudiation were extremely high.  I have already found it likely that the legal effect in Germany of repudiation would be to make the Agreement unenforceable.  The Husband, however, has made much of his wish to do the right thing by this Wife, to whom he was married for over thirty years and with whom he had his only son.  I decided in his favour in 2019.  In one sense, I have done so again by coming to the conclusion that the Dusseldorf Agreement should be enforced. I do so on the assumption and belief that he will now abide by the terms of the Agreement and the order that I intend to make. \n\t    "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 27. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The issue of publication of a judgment, and consequential reporting, was considered by the Court of Appeal in  \n\t   Griffiths v Tickle & Ors   [2021] EWCA Civ 1882 , an unusual case concerning, amongst other matters, the publication of a judgment naming the parties to proceedings concerning a child. In summarising the law to be applied the Court of Appeal noted: \n\t     \n\t   '27. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     \n\t     The right to freedom of expression, protected by Article 10 of the Convention, encompasses a right to speak to others, including the public at large, about the events and experiences of one's private and family life. As Munby J (as he then was) pointed out in Re Angela Roddy  [2003] EWHC 2927 (Fam) ,  [2004] EMLR 8  [35-36] this is also a facet of the right to respect for private and family life: \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       \"ï¿½Ä¶ amongst the rights protected by Article 8 ï¿½Ä¶ is the right, as a human being, to share with others ' and, if one so chooses, with the world at large ' one's own storyï¿½Ä¶\". \n\t     \n\t   28. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Corresponding to the right of an individual to impart information about his or her private and family life, without interference by a public authority, is the fundamental right of others to receive such information, without such interference. That is a right enjoyed by the media parties here, as well as the general public. \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   34. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Other considerations may come into play when information is disclosed or ascertained in the course of legal proceedings. The court is directly involved and in control of the process. It has the ability and the right to control the flow of information. As a public authority it has a duty to do so in a way that is compatible with the Convention rights - which in this context include the fair trial rights guaranteed by Article 6 as well as those protected by Articles 8 and 10. But the firmly established starting point in the domestic jurisprudence is the principle of open justice. The general rule is that proceedings are held in public and what is said, including the names of the parties and witnesses, can be observed and reported. In a case which involves the \"determination\" of criminal liability or civil rights and obligations, Article 6 confers on each party to litigation the right to a public hearing and a public judgment. Publicity for what goes on in court may be embarrassing and painful for those involved and third parties who are indirectly and incidentally affected but in general, \"the collateral impact that this process has on those affected is part of the price to be paid for open justice and the freedom of the press to report fairly and accurately on judicial proceedings held in public\": Khuja v Times Newspapers Ltd  [2017] UKSC 49 , [2019] AC [34(2)]. \n\t     \n\t   35. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The open justice principle and the related rights under Articles 6 and 10 are all subject to exceptions, but these are narrow and circumscribed and their application in an individual case requires strict justification. The category of exception that is relevant here is the need to protect private and family life rights, including in particular the rights of children. This was to the fore in Re S, where a mother was charged with the murder of one of her children. S, aged 5, was the brother of the deceased. The Guardian of S, concerned that reporting of the criminal trial would be seriously detrimental to S's welfare, sought an order for the mother and both children to be anonymised in any such reporting. The application was ultimately refused by the High Court, and appeals were dismissed by this Court and the House of Lords.  \n\t     \n\t   36. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     \n\t     The House held that the jurisdiction to restrain publicity to protect a child's private and family life was now founded upon the Convention Rights. In a case where the child was not a party or witness and the interference with his Article 8 rights was indirect there was no justification for creating any new category of exception to the normal rule of open justice or otherwise interfering with free reporting of the trial. At [17], Lord Steyn famously identified four key propositions as to how the court should address a conflict between Articles 8 and 10. The passage is very familiar, but because it is so important to the present appeal we cite it: \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       \"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values under the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each. For convenience I will call this the ultimate balancing test.\" \n\t     \n\t   37. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The \"intense focus\" must be brought to bear on the particular facts of the case. As Sir Mark Potter, P, memorably put it, the Re S approach \"is not a mechanical exercise to be decided on the basis of rival generalities\": A Local Authority v W  [2005] EWHC 1564 (Fam) ,  [2006] 1 FLR 1  [53]. \n\t     \n\t   38. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The four propositions distilled by Lord Steyn in Re S were derived from the earlier decision of the House in Campbell v MGN Ltd  [2004] UKHL 22 ,  [2004] 2 AC 457 . There, the House explored the interplay between Articles 8 and 10 in the context of a complaint about press disclosure of the claimant's drug taking and rehabilitation. In the course of so doing, the House affirmed a principle of relevance to the present case. The claimant had falsely denied taking drugs. As Lord Hope put it at [82], \"where a public figure chooses to make untrue pronouncements about his or her private life, the press will normally be entitled to put the record straight\". (See also, to similar effect, Lord Hoffmann at [58] and Baroness Hale at [151]: \"The press must be free to expose the truth and put the record straight\"). The reporters rely on this principle as providing a public interest justification for the disclosure of at least parts of the judgment of HHJ Williscroft.  \n\t     \n\t   39. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     \n\t     Campbell is also important for what it says about the hierarchy of different kinds of speech. As Baroness Hale said at [148]:  \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       \"There are undoubtedly different types of speech, just as there are different types of private information, some of which are more deserving of protection in a democratic society than others. Top of the list is political speech. The free exchange of information and ideas on matters relevant to the organisation of the economic, social and political life of the country is crucial to any democracy. Without this, it can scarcely be called a democracy at all. This includes revealing information about public figures, especially those in elective office, which would otherwise be private but is relevant to their participation in public life.\" \n\t     \n\t 40. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Another factor relevant to the assessment of the comparative importance or weight of the specific rights in play in a Re S balancing exercise is the extent to which the information, the disclosure of which is under consideration, has or is about to become available to the public.  Section 12(4) (a)(i) of the  Human Rights Act 1998  (\"HRA\") requires the court to have regard to this factor, when considering whether to make an order which affects the right to freedom of expression, in proceedings that relate to journalistic material. This will be a relevant factor in decisions about publication of a judgment, whether or not the statutory wording is strictly applicable. It is obvious that where disclosure of the same information has already taken place, or is imminent, the case for keeping the judgment private is weakened.'"

I can also understand that the children's home would be easier to manage with a system of earned privileges under which a key fob has to be 'earned' by a degree of co-operation and commitment to the regime that the home's operator is seeking to establish.  However, there are strict statutory tests that have to be fulfilled before a child can be lawfully detained in a secure (i.e. locked) accommodation and a set of oversight measures which exist to ensure that any deprivation of liberty is not extended for longer than is justified.   It is not appropriate in my judgment to use the DOL regime to either lessen the conditions which have to be satisfied before a child can be placed in secure locked accommodation or to bypass the review systems.   \n\t  "

One consequence of the lack of sufficient secure placements is that local authorities turn to the High Court to authorise a DOLS placement in other accommodation, often at very significant additional cost. Frequently, as the reported judgments describe, and as X's circumstances demonstrate, the accommodation that is authorised via DOLS is not appropriate to meet the young person's needs and is simply chosen as being the 'least worse', and often the only, option that is available."

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 122. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t It is not usual in cases such as these for there to be expert evidence regarding the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in question, setting out any prospective safeguards that may be available. I have in mind the words of the Court of Appeal in  \n\t   Re R  in addition to those in the seminal judgement of Lord Justice Thorpe in  Re K (Removal from Jurisdiction: Practice)   [1999] 2 FLR 1084 ),. ' The overriding consideration for the Court in deciding whether to allow a parent to take a child to a non-Hague Convention country is whether the making of that order would be in the best interests of the child. Where (as in most cases) there is some risk of abduction and an obvious detriment to the child if that risk were to materialise, the Court has to be positively satisÔ¨ï¿½ed that the advantages to the child of her visiting that country outweigh the risks to her welfare which the visit will entail. This will therefore routinely involve the Court in investigating what safeguards can be put in place to minimise the risk of retention and to secure the child's return if that transpires. Those safeguards should be capable of having a real and tangible effect in the jurisdiction in which they are to operate and be capable of being easily accessed by the UK-based parent. Although, in common with Black LJ in  Re M ,  we do not say that no application of this category can proceed in the absence of expert evidence, we consider that there is a need in most cases for the effectiveness of any suggested safeguard to be established by competent and complete expert evidence which deals speciÔ¨ï¿½cally and in detail with that issue. If in doubt the Court should err on the side of caution and refuse to make the order. If the judge decides to proceed in the absence of expert evidence, then very clear reasons are required to justify such a course.'"

Nor in my view is it a good reason to depart from the general principle that this was an appeal rather than a first instance trial. Once again, the fact that it is an appeal rather than a trial may be relevant to whether or not a party has behaved reasonably in relation to the litigation. As Wall LJ pointed out in  \n\t     In re M (A Child)   [2009] EWCA Civ 311 , there are differences between trials and appeals. At first instance, 'nobody knows what the judge is going to find' (para 23), whereas on appeal the factual findings are known. Not only that, the judge's reasons are known. Both parties have an opportunity to 'take stock' (para 24), and consider whether they should proceed to advance or resist an appeal and to negotiate on the basis of what they now know. So it may well be that conduct which was reasonable at first instance is no longer reasonable on appeal.

Both parties should be entitled to know the full extent of their financial obligations to, and dependence on, the other.  I cannot know at this stage what the wife's recovery will be from any arrangement she is able to negotiate through the variation of the trust structure which I propose to make at the conclusion of these proceedings but I have confidence from the evidence before the court that it is likely to deliver value in excess of that which the husband is currently offering through his current lump sum proposal. It will be a matter for her as to how she structures her finances in terms of remitting those funds in a tax efficient manner but that is the inevitable result of the variation of the settlement which she seeks. From the foot of that outcome, she will have the financial security of knowing that she will be receiving ongoing income support for the next ten years.  During that period she will have ample time to develop her own earning capacity in order to meet her needs going forward and provide, in due course, for the time when she is no longer in paid employment.  The personal and financial circumstances of each of these parties may change as those ten years unfold but I am not in a position at this point in time to legislate prospectively for future events. It may be that the husband is in a position in due course to buy out any remaining income claims should his financial fortunes improve as I hope they might.  What I can determine at this stage is that the wife will have sufficient time over the next decade to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of that ongoing spousal support so as to justify prospectively a bar on her ability to extend that term. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     My decision"

The Court of Appeal in  Re A (A Child)  [2016] EWCA 759; [2016] All ER (D) 183 said the following (ï¿½ï¿½31), with reference to Lady Hale's judgment in  Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust v James   [2013] UKSC 67 ;  [2014] AC 591 : \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t      'Whilst its application requires sensitivity and care of the highest order, the law relating to applications to withdraw life sustaining treatment is now clear and well established. It can be summed up with economy by reference to two paragraphs from the speech of Baroness Hale in what is generally regarded as the leading case on the topic, notwithstanding that it related to an adult, against the backdrop of the  Mental Capacity Act 2005 . In Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust v James  [2013] UKSC 67 ;  [2014] AC 591  Baroness Hale said at paragraph 22:-  \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'Hence the focus is on whether it is in the patient's best interests to give the treatment rather than whether it is in his best interests to withhold or withdraw it. If the treatment is not in his best interests, the court will not be able to give its consent on his behalf and it will follow that it will be lawful to withhold or withdraw it. Indeed, it will follow that it will not be lawful to give it. It also follows that (provided of course they have acted reasonably and without negligence) the clinical team will not be in breach of any duty toward the patient if they withhold or withdraw it.' "

(5) An application under this paragraph may be made in other family proceedings or without any other family proceedings being instituted.

Power to make order in criminal proceedings 3 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in England and Wales for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 4 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence. (2) In the case of an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 5(1), a person can be guilty of an offence under this paragraph only in respect of conduct engaged in at a time when the person was aware of the existence of the order. (3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct, the conduct is not punishable as a contempt of court. (4) A person cannot be convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct which has been punished as a contempt of court.

(2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under sub-paragraph (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the risk to the girl, or to another person, of becoming a victim of a genital mutilation offence if the order is not made immediately, (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately, and (c) whether there is reason to believe thatÄî (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service, and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the girl to be protected or (if different) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about an order made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1). (4) The opportunity must beÄî (a) as soon as just and convenient, and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court.

(2) The relevant judge must not issue a warrant on an application under sub-paragraph (1) unlessÄî (a) the application is substantiated on oath, and (b) the relevant judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) In this paragraph Äú interested party Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) the girl being protected by the order, (b) (if a different person) the person who applied for the order, or (c) any other person; but no application may be made under sub-paragraph (1) by a person falling within paragraph (c) without leave of the relevant judge. Remand: general 8 (1) The court before which an arrested person is brought by virtue of a warrant under paragraph 7 may, if the matter is not then disposed of immediately, remand the person concerned.

(3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies if a person remanded under this paragraph is granted bail under paragraphs 10 to 14. (4) The person may be required by the relevant judge to comply, before release on bail or later, with such requirements as appear to the judge to be necessary to secure that the person does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Remand: medical examination and report 9 (1) Any power to remand a person under paragraph 8(1) may be exercised for the purpose of enabling a medical examination and report to be made if the relevant judge has reason to consider that a medical report will be required. (2) If such a power is so exercised, the adjournment must not be for more than four weeks at a time unless the relevant judge remands the accused in custody. (3) If the relevant judge remands the accused in custody, the adjournment must not be for more than three weeks at a time. (4) Sub-paragraph (5) applies if there is reason to suspect that a person who has been arrested under a warrant issued on an application under paragraph 7(1) is suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. (5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Remand: further provision 10 (1) Where a court has power to remand a person under paragraph 8, the court may remand the person in custody or on bail. (2) If remanded in custody, the person is to be committed to custody to be brought before the courtÄî (a) at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at such earlier time as the court may require. (3) The court may remand a person on bailÄî (a) by taking from the person a recognizance (with or without sureties) conditioned as provided in paragraph 11, or (b) by fixing the amount of the recognizances with a view to their being taken subsequently in accordance with paragraph 14 and, in the meantime, committing the person to custody as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above. (4) Where a person is brought before the court after remand the court may further remand the person. (5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent. (2) If sub-paragraph (1)(a) applies, the person may be remanded for the period of the adjournment. (3) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody, the person may be committed to the custody of a constable if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days. 13 (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear before the court at the end of the period of remand, the court may further remand the person in his or her absence. (2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge. Other protection or assistance against female genital mutilation 16 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects any other protection or assistance available to a girl who is or may become the victim of a genital mutilation offence.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   My overall conclusions \n\t     \n\t   59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to my conclusions.  I am going to start by considering the various factors that I am directed by  \n\t     section 16(2)  of  the 1984 Act  to have particular regard to.  First, I will consider the connection which the parties to the marriage have to this jurisdiction.  I am clear that there is sufficient connection in this case for me to make a financial award in principle.  The parties had a home here.  Even though it was on a short-lease, the Husband demonstrated that he could extend that lease by doing so in 2016.  Valentin was educated here at Millfield and then at the European Business School in London.  At least initially, the medical procedures relating to his heart difficulties took place here.   The parties visited here regularly.  The Wife was very attached to this country and decided to make her life here when the marriage broke down.  Whether this was, originally, a tactical decision or not, I am satisfied that she does now intend to live here indefinitely.   \n\t     \n\t   60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Turning to their connection with Germany, it is, of course, the case that they are both German.  They were born there.  They lived there pretty constantly until the year 2000.  They married there.  They had a Pre-Marital Agreement there. Even after they left for Switzerland, they retained connections with Germany.  I gave examples in my previous judgment but, for these purposes, I will merely note the Wife's continuing attachment to her German hairdresser, Marianne and the long-standing role performed by Dr Maschmeier on behalf of the Husband.  Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the fact that they left Germany in 2000, primarily for tax reasons.  Such moves occur in so many of the financial remedy cases that I hear.  The super-rich do appear to consider that such moves have no adverse consequences whatsoever.  I do not agree.  When it comes to Part III applications, it is relevant to my consideration that Germany was abandoned as a place of residence twenty-two years ago.  It follows that I do not consider the German links to be so strong as to prevent me from making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I must next consider their connection to Switzerland.  There is no doubt that the Husband lives there.  Valentin lives and works there as well.  The Husband's children by his first marriage also reside there.  I have not investigated just how deep the Husband's roots are in Switzerland.  I did, however, investigate those of the Wife in my previous judgment and I found that she did not integrate in that country; was deeply unhappy there; and could not wait to leave following the breakdown of the marriage.   Again, I am clear that the Swiss connection does not prevent me making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   62. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to the financial benefit that the Wife has received or is likely to receive outside this jurisdiction.  The answer is that, at least in the German divorce proceedings, she has received no benefit at all.  This is, of course, because she instructed her German lawyers to ensure her claims were dismissed.  The Husband says that this is equivalent to omitting to apply at all, which has to be considered under  \n\t     section 16(2) (f).  I must, therefore, consider whether she was justified in the stance that she took.  In this regard, I can come to reasonably clear conclusions.  I am satisfied that, pursuant to German law, the Wife would not have been awarded any capital provision at all.  This was because of a mixture of the Pre-Marital Agreement and the fact that there was no marital acquest.  I am satisfied that, even if she had succeeded in setting aside the Pre-Marital Agreement, it would have only been to enable her to receive maintenance.  Given the indication of Judge Block, on the balance of probabilities, I find that she would have done so, but not to obtain a capital award.  I am equally clear that the level of maintenance that she would then have received would have been modest.  At a maximum, she would have obtained an order equivalent to the sum the Husband was paying voluntarily but certainly not ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum or ï¿½Ç¨400,000 per annum.  To achieve a capital award, she would have had to change the law, as Mrs White did here.  I am clear that she was told by the Husband that he would contest this all the way and that it would take ten years, as she would have to go to the Federal Court in Germany, without any guarantee of a successful outcome.  I have no doubt he made this abundantly clear to her.  As it was said via his lawyers, it cannot be asserted that this was undue pressure but it was pressure and she succumbed.  I am clear that it was not unreasonable for her to do so.  Whether she was unreasonable not to conclude a deal with him in Germany, given that he was making offers far in excess of what she could have obtained in court, is an entirely different matter.  Fortunately, I do not need to answer it, given the existence of the May 2022 Dusseldorf Agreement.  It follows that I do not consider the fact that she asked the German Court to dismiss her claims to be fatal to her application here.   \n\t     \n\t   63. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst I have dealt with the provision she received in the German divorce proceedings, that does not cover any financial benefit which she has received or is likely to receive in Germany by virtue of an agreement.  In dealing with this, I do, of course, accept that she has repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  I have not heard expert evidence as to the law in Germany, but I consider it reasonable to assume that it will be the same as our contract law.  In other words, following the repudiation, she cannot change her mind and enforce the Agreement.  That does not mean that the Husband could not do so, but I consider it highly unlikely that he would attempt to do so now.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the provision agreed in Dusseldorf was something that she could have enforced on 23 May 2022, if she had gone down that route rather than repudiating the Agreement.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   64. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I therefore turn to consider the circumstances of the signing of the Agreement, applying the dicta in  \n\t     Edgar v Edgar .  I find that the Wife was extremely keen to conclude an agreement with the Husband.  I cannot see that he had nearly the same incentive as her.  I accept that Valentin was also keen to see if he could broker a settlement.  I am satisfied that the initial idea for the meeting came from the Wife.  She pressed for it.  She was willing to go both to Zurich and Dusseldorf to obtain an agreement.  She did so entirely willingly and without any pressure.  I find that she wanted to encourage the Husband to engage.  She knew that he did not want her lawyers involved, so she was happy to say that she would keep it secret from them.  I do not find she was pressurised to do so.  I do accept that Valentin's question about her wanting to tell her lawyers was designed to obtain a confirmation that she would not do so, but she agreed without being forced to do so.  In other words, it was not a condition of the meetings.  In fact, she eventually broke this promise by telling Mr Westley on 11 May 2022, although she did not do so at the consultation with Mr Chamberlayne on 9 May 2022.  I simply cannot speculate as to what happened when she told Mr Westley, other than to note that it did not prevent her going to Dusseldorf. It follows that I find that it was her choice to negotiate without Mr Westley or Mr Chamberlayne.  Whilst  Edgar  specifically refers to the lack of legal advice as being a potential reason for not enforcing such an agreement, I accept that the law has moved on since then and, in particular, following the decision of the Supreme Court in  Radmacher v Granatino   [2010] UKSC 42 .  The absence of legal advice is not fatal, if the unrepresented party has a proper appreciation of the Agreement reached.  I find that this Wife undoubtedly did have such a proper appreciation.  \n\t     \n\t   65. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I next turn to the second aspect, namely the asserted threats that she would get nothing if she did not sign the Dusseldorf Agreement.  The first point to make is that the Wife has, throughout, been aware of potential significant enforcement difficulties.  She had seen the three opinions which had been served further to the Husband's submissions opposing her application for permission to make this application.  She knew that it was one of the three reasons why it was said by him that I should not give leave.  I do not, of course, know what advice she received but it will not have been a surprise to her that this was relied on by both the Husband and Valentin.  I am satisfied that they did rely on it, but I am not satisfied that they took unfair advantage of this fact.  After all, the Husband was offering significant provision to the Wife.  If he had really intended to play hard-ball, I consider his offer would have been much lower than it was.  I am satisfied that the Wife was under pressure.  All litigants are under pressure as litigation is costly with no certainty of success.  I accept that she was under more pressure than the Husband who had very little to lose.  Nevertheless, on the balance of probabilities, I have come to the conclusion that the Wife was not under 'undue pressure' as described in  \n\t     Edgar .  In reaching this conclusion, I have been particularly influenced by her demeanour as described by both Valentin and Dr Maschmeier.  She was not some 'supplicant cowed into submission' by a bullying husband and son.  She was the driving force behind the meetings taking place at all.  She went not once but twice.  On the second occasion, she went notwithstanding having spoken to her lawyer about the first meeting.  I have accepted Dr Maschmeier's evidence as to what happened when he arrived.  She did not seem upset, disappointed or distressed at all.  The opposite was the case.  She was very relieved.  At the time, she considered the Agreement to be a good result.  She engaged entirely voluntarily with the champagne toast.  She was not desperate to leave.  Her comment about signing her death warrant was humorous and light-hearted.  It may have reflected some nagging doubts, but no more than that. She had reached an agreement with her Husband voluntarily and with her eyes open. I am fortified in this conclusion when I remind myself that I am also specifically directed to consider the extent to which any imposed order here would be likely to be enforceable.  Given that enforceability is an issue that I am required to consider, I find it difficult to see how I could say that raising the issue would be fatal to any subsequent agreement reached.   \n\t     \n\t   66. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do, however, take the view that I should consider the terms of the Agreement reached in the light of this Part III application.  I am clear that the provision set out in the Dusseldorf Agreement is very much within the bracket of possible awards that I might have made had there been no meetings in Zurich or Dusseldorf.  It follows that it certainly cannot be said that unfair or undue pressure caused the Wife to sign an Agreement that was unfair or outside the range of possible orders she could have got from the court.  I have already referred to my decision in  \n\t     MA v SK  in which I decided that the facts of that case meant that I should make an award that was 'needs light'.  I am clear that exactly the same sort of considerations apply here.  \n\t     \n\t   67. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If I had simply started with a blank sheet of paper, I am clear that I would have taken the view that a suitable London property for the Wife would have been Kinnerton Street.  If this had been an entirely English case, she would have received a considerably more valuable property, but it is not.  I cannot ignore the provision she would have got in Germany.  I would have taken the view that the freehold should be acquired or that the lease should be extended by thirty-five years as suggested by Mr Chamberlayne in his closing submissions.  I am equally clear that I would have considered it reasonable to refurbish/renovate the property and that the sum of ï¿½ï¿½800,000 to ï¿½ï¿½1 million would be appropriate.  The one likely departure from the Agreement is that I would have found that the property should be owned by the Wife, not by Valentin, but that is certainly not fatal.  There is always give and take in reaching an Agreement.  Provided the Wife has absolute security of occupation throughout her lifetime, there is no significant prejudice to her in the property being in the name of her son.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   68. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I would also have come to the conclusion that she should have a second home in the country.  In my judgment in the divorce proceedings, I mentioned this second home being in Germany but it is, of course, entirely up to the Wife where she has such a second home.  I am satisfied that, even allowing for the Part III considerations, a second home would be appropriate in a case where the parties had been married for 32 years and the Husband was worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.  I made such a finding in  \n\t     MA v SK  and I would have done so here.  The quantum of the provision, however, is a very different matter.  I would not have considered that the home should be the sort of home regularly occupied by multi-millionaires in the Home Counties.  I would have considered that a more modest property would be appropriate.  The capital award agreed was ï¿½Ç¨3 million.   At the current rate of exchange, this is just over ï¿½ï¿½2.5 million.  The Wife needs to discharge her liabilities in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½230,000.  She would therefore have just under ï¿½ï¿½2 million for a property, taking into account the costs of purchase.  I could not possibly say that this would be unreasonable given the Husband's property particular of Manor Farm House, Frilford, Oxon at a guide price of ï¿½ï¿½1.25 million.  I do accept that I do not know how much work would be required to that property but, in principle, the lump sum agreed would meet her 'needs light', even if she wanted to retain part of the money, previously described in our courts as a  Besterman  cushion.  I do, of course, accept that I would not have given the Husband a year to pay the second instalment but, as the price of obtaining enforceability, I consider this delay to be a small price to pay. \n\t     \n\t   69. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to maintenance. I accept that the standard of living was immensely high in this case.  Nevertheless, I could not have ignored the likely quantum of an order in Germany.  It would definitely have served to reduce downwards my award.  In Germany, the Husband had originally offered ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum whilst the Wife sought ï¿½ï¿½600,000 per annum.  I consider the agreed figure of ï¿½Ç¨480,000, which is currently equivalent to just over ï¿½ï¿½400,000 per annum, undoubtedly to be within the appropriate bracket.  I very much doubt my award would have been higher.  I suspect it might have been somewhat lower, given that I ordered ï¿½ï¿½225,000 per annum in  \n\t     MA v SK .   \n\t     \n\t   70. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do take the view that I would have been likely to capitalise the payment.  This would be in accordance with  \n\t     the Act  that requires me to have this as my objective.  It would be in accordance with the authorities.  After all, I capitalised the maintenance in  MA v SK .  Capitalisation is clearly possible in this case given that the Husband accepts he is worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.   I do not, however, consider that this likelihood would mean that I would never have made a periodical payments order.  I am required to consider the position in Germany and the extent of the enforceability of my award.  Suppose the Husband had attended in my court and told me that he wanted to be generous and would agree to an order in the sum of ï¿½Ç¨480,000 per annum, provided it was not capitalised.  I consider it at least possible that I would have agreed.  In any event, that is not the test.  The Agreement was a compromise. The Wife traded the probability of obtaining a capitalised lump sum from me and the possibility that she might enforce that order, for the certainty of generous monthly maintenance provision. I would not even hesitate in finding that such a decision was a reasonable one for her to adopt.   \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     By way of one final cross-check, I intend just to cover briefly the capital value of the Agreement if it had been ordered outright.  Before doing so, I remind myself that my award in  \n\t     MA v SK  was ï¿½ï¿½10 million in late 2014, which would equate to around ï¿½ï¿½12.75 million today.  The Dusseldorf Agreement would be worth a very similar sum, namely:- \n\t       \n\t     (a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Kinnerton Street (freehold/long leasehold) \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 \n\t       \n\t     (b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Works to Kinnerton Street \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½   900,000 \n\t       \n\t     (c) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Lump sum of ï¿½Ç¨3 million \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½2,500,000 \n\t       \n\t     (d) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Capitalised value of maintenance ( \n\t       Duxbury) ï¿½ï¿½4,750,000 \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Total \n\t                 ï¿½ï¿½12,250,000 \n\t     \n\t 72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   For me, the huge tragedy of this case is that the Wife repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  She clearly had 'buyer's remorse' but the risks of repudiation were extremely high.  I have already found it likely that the legal effect in Germany of repudiation would be to make the Agreement unenforceable.  The Husband, however, has made much of his wish to do the right thing by this Wife, to whom he was married for over thirty years and with whom he had his only son.  I decided in his favour in 2019.  In one sense, I have done so again by coming to the conclusion that the Dusseldorf Agreement should be enforced. I do so on the assumption and belief that he will now abide by the terms of the Agreement and the order that I intend to make. \n\t    "

The reasons that Z does not want to go back to the Czech Republic are noted to be that she struggles to learn in the Czech language in school, a difficult home life with mother and stepfather, feeling 'British' and wanting to live in England; \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   e) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Crucially, Ms Gwynne concludes both in written and oral evidence that Z is expressing an objection rather than a 'preference' because the assertions she makes remain consistent, even after she spent two nights with her mother and siblings at the end of September 2023. Ms Gwynne says that ' \n\t     it is more difficult for a child to continue with this rhetoric after having spent time with the left-behind parent unless there is sincerity and depth to their wishes '. \n\t     \n\t f) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Ms Gwynne suggests the court may consider the 'gateway' stage is met and reflects on matters which fall to be considered in the exercise of discretion as to whether to make a return order. \n\t    "

(2) The applicants must be' (a) husband and wife, (b) civil partners of each other, or (c) two persons who are living as partners in an enduring family relationship and are not within prohibited degrees of relationship in relation to each other. (3) Except in a case falling within subsection (11), the applicants must apply for the order during the period of 6 months beginning with the day on which the child is born. (4) At the time of the application and the making of the order' (a) the child's home must be with the applicants, and (b) either or both of the applicants must be domiciled in the United Kingdom or in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. (5) At the time of the making of the order both the applicants must have attained the age of 18. (6) The court must be satisfied that both' (a) the woman who carried the child, and (b) any other person who is a parent of the child but is not one of the applicants (including any man who is the father by virtue of section 35 or 36 or any woman who is a parent by virtue of section 42 or 43), have freely, and with full understanding of what is involved, agreed unconditionally to the making of the order. (7) Subsection (6) does not require the agreement of a person who cannot be found or is incapable of giving agreement; and the agreement of the woman who carried the child is ineffective for the purpose of that subsection if given by her less than six weeks after the child's birth. (8) The court must be satisfied that no money or other benefit (other than for expenses reasonably incurred) has been given or received by either of the applicants for or in consideration of' (a) the making of the order, (b) any agreement required by subsection (6), (c) the handing over of the child to the applicants, or (d) the making of arrangements with a view to the making of the order, unless authorised by the court. (8A) An order relating to the child must not previously have been made under this section or section 54A, unless the order has been quashed or an appeal against the order has been allowed. (9) For the purposes of an application under this section' (a) in relation to England and Wales ' (i) 'the court' means the High Court or the family court, and (ii) proceedings on the application are to be ' family proceedings ' for the purposes of the Children Act 1989, (b) in relation to Scotland, ' the court ' means the Court of Session or the sheriff court of the sheriffdom within which the child is, and (c) in relation to Northern Ireland, ' the court ' means the High Court or any county court .... (10) Subsection (1)(a) applies whether the woman was in the United Kingdom or elsewhere at the time of the placing in her of the embryo or the sperm and eggs or her artificial insemination. (11) An application which' (a) relates to a child born before the coming into force of this section, and (b) is made by two persons who, throughout the period applicable under subsection (2) of section 30 of the 1990 Act, were not eligible to apply for an order under that section in relation to the child as husband and wife, may be made within the period of six months beginning with the day on which this section comes into force." ] ,

She is clearly a much loved and wanted child.  She needs a parental order to give permanence and security to her care arrangements in circumstances where no one else other than the applicants seek to provide lifelong care for her.  As Mr Powell put it, QR enjoys a family life with the applicants, that is her social reality.  A parental order will not only reflect her life story but will make her legally part of the applicants' family, thereby ensuring her social and legal realities are congruent.  I observe that QR will need a full understanding of how she came to be born and will require support and love from her family to deal with this information as and when it is made known to her.  EF has told me that he and his wife intend to impart that information to QR in a child-focused and appropriate way.   \n\t  "

She has merely exercised her wide powers of case management to require the parties to conclude the well-advanced divorce litigation in Russia as a condition precedent for proceeding in this jurisdiction.  In so doing she has examined all the advantages and disadvantages of taking that course.  She has considered all those matters embraced within the overriding objective.  From the foot of a careful and measured overview, she has reached her conclusions that the English Sch 1 proceedings will be more cost-effective both in terms of judicial resources, court time and expense to the parties if there is clear definition of the parties' adjusted financial resources as reflected in a forensic conclusion to the Russian proceedings."

In earlier days, in the case of  \n\t   Thynne , the rules were not as clear and detailed as they are now, and the inherent jurisdiction was more often resorted to by the court, to do right between the parties. There is no need to do that here. We have a rule, and, just as Sir James Munby relied upon the same rule in  M v P , it seems to me that that is the proper course for this court to take.

This is because, inevitably, an order would be made in Scotland requiring the return of the child (or some other suitable child arrangements made), and such order would be automatically recognised in England pursuant to the terms of  \n\t   section 25  of the  Family Law Act 1986 . But the mutual recognition of orders under  section 25  only applies to orders made in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is no automatic statutory recognition of orders between the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories. Nor does the mutual recognition of orders regime under the 1996 Hague Convention apply to orders made in British Overseas Territories. It would seem that the only way in which a return order made in a British Overseas Territory could be recognised would be pursuant to the common law. The common law on the recognition of foreign orders about children was recently analysed by the Privy Council in  C v C (Jersey) [2019] UKPC 40 . As I understand it such a foreign order can and should be recognised unless it would be contrary to public policy to do so. The Privy CouncilÄôs analysis demonstrates that in determining the question of public policy the court does not embark on a full welfare-based enquiry. "

Prior to the  ACA 2002  reforms it was not possible for a step-parent to be granted a free standing order for parental responsibility. The only other option, therefore, was adoption.  A further difficulty under the pre  ACA 2002  law was that any such adoption had to be a joint adoption by the step-parent together with their spouse, who was one of the child's natural parents (...)

The Supreme Court in  \n\t   E  held at [31-34] that Article 13(b), by its very terms, is of restricted application.  In addition to the burden being on the parent opposing return to establish the defence: \n\t     \n\t   30.1. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The risk of harm to the child must be 'grave'.  It is not enough that the risk be 'real'.  The risk must reach a certain level of seriousness as to be characterized as 'grave'.  Although 'grave' characterizes the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.  Thus, a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as 'grave' while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm:  \n\t     Re. E , [33]. \n\t     \n\t   30.2. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The child must be put at risk of 'physical or psychological harm' or otherwise placed in an 'intolerable situation'.  'Intolerable' gives colour to the term 'physical or psychological harm'.  It is a 'strong word', but when applied to a child must mean 'a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate'.  Every child must put up with a certain level of 'rough and tumble, discomfort and distress', but there are 'some things it is not reasonable for a child to tolerate'.  Among these are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child, as well as 'exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent':  \n\t     Re. E , [34].  I return to this, below, under the heading 'controlling and coercive behaviour'. \n\t     \n\t   30.3. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Article 13(b) looks to the future: the situation as it would be if the child were to be returned forthwith to her home country, having regard to any protective measures that may be put in place to safeguard the child from such harm:  \n\t     Re. E , ibid, [35].  There may, objectively, be a 'grave risk' that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation if they are returned (whether with or without the removing parent) to live with the left-behind parent without any protective measures.  But if, for example, the child can be returned to a different setting, with effective restrictions on the left-behind parent having any contact with them and the removing parent, then the threshold required for Article 13(b) purposes will not be crossed.  The gravity of the risk of harm, including both its likelihood and the potential seriousness of the harm, needs to be evaluated in the light of the availability and efficacy of any protective measures.  'The clearer the need for protection, the more effective the protective measures must be':  Re. E , [52], cited in  Re. S (Abduction: Article 13(b)) (Mental Health)  [2023] EWCA Civ 208 , [92]. \n\t     \n\t 30.4. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Relevant protective measures may include anything which might reduce the risk, including general features of the home State such as access to the courts and other state services:  \n\t     Re. C   [2019] 1 FLR 1045 , [41].   The measures may also include orders made by the court in the requested state or undertakings given by the left-behind parent requiring them, for example, not to contact the removing parent pending the resolution of children's proceedings in the requesting state.  In assessing the efficacy of any such orders or undertakings, the fact that they are enforceable in the requesting state under the terms of the 1996 Hague Convention \n\t\t    is a relevant consideration:   Full name the 'Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children Protection of Children 1996' \n\t\t Re. Y (Abduction: Undertakings)   [2013] 2 FLR 649 .  If there is any doubt as to the availability or efficacy of protective measures, enquiries may be made through the international liaison judges and a short adjournment may be necessary for that purpose:  E v D  [2022] EWHC 1216 Fam, [32].

(2) The making of an adoption order operates to extinguishÄî (a) the parental responsibility which any person other than the adopters or adopter has for the adopted child immediately before the making of the order, (b) any order under the 1989 Act or the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 ( S.I. 1995/755 (N.I. 2)), (c) any order under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 36) other than an excepted order, and (ca) any child assessment order or child protection order within the meaning given in section 202(1) of the ChildrenÄôs Hearing (Scotland) Act 2011, (d) any duty arising by virtue of an agreement or an order of a court to make payments, so far as the payments are in respect of the adopted childÄôs maintenance or upbringing for any period after the making of the adoption order. Äú Excepted order Äù means an order under section 9, 11(1)(d) or 13 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 or an exclusion order within the meaning of section 76(1) of that Act. (3) An adoption orderÄî (a) does not affect parental responsibility so far as it relates to any period before the making of the order, and (b) in the case of an order made on an application under section 51(2) by the partner of a parent of the adopted child, does not affect the parental responsibility of that parent or any duties of that parent within subsection (2)(d). (4) Subsection (2)(d) does not apply to a duty arising by virtue of an agreementÄî (a) which constitutes a trust, or (b) which expressly provides that the duty is not to be extinguished by the making of an adoption order. (5) An adoption order may be made even if the child to be adopted is already an adopted child. (6) Before making an adoption order, the court must consider whether there should be arrangements for allowing any person contact with the child; and for that purpose the court must consider any existing or proposed arrangements and obtain any views of the parties to the proceedings."

The reasons given for non-disclosure concerned the risk to the mother's wellbeing and her account of the improbability of a suitable family placement. As to the first, disclosure would be likely to be difficult for the mother, but there was no convincing evidence to support the judge's conclusion that it might be \"disastrous\". The rejection of the possibility of a family placement was based on the mother's account without there being any objective basis for believing that the father and the wider families were very likely to have nothing to offer. Nor was any real weight given to the potential benefits to A of growing up in his birth family if that is a realistic possibility, or of his adoption having his father's participation, and even his blessing, if it is not. I would not accept the local authority's characterisation of the process of notifying a father of the birth of his child as \"opening a can of worms\" where the characteristics of the father or wider family raise no particular cause for concern. The judge was entitled to note the delay involved in notification, but as the child had already been placed with prospective adopters, little weight could attach to that aspect of the matter. In summary, while the judge rightly gave significant emphasis to the mother's point of view, he did not sufficiently balance it against the other important considerations bearing on A's lifelong welfare and the position of family members, and his decision cannot therefore stand.  \n\t    "

Both the  \n\t   Adoption and Children Act 2002  and the jurisprudence of the court in Strasberg look at relationship in this context on a life-long basis. What the court is being invited to do is not simply provide someone with permanent and secure parental responsibility for H for the next few months before he reaches the age of 18.  This application is not about parental responsibility; it is about parental relationship and family relationship.  Far more important is to cement the reality of the emotional, psychological and lived experience of these two in a legal structure and afford legal status to the applicant.  It simply matches how life is being lived by the two of them and by both sides of H's family, now and for the future.  In that context, it is hard to under-estimate the importance of the application that is being made. "

Any other order either fails to achieve anything that is of much use in terms of the attribution of parental responsibility to the applicant for the remaining months of H's minority; or achieves an outcome which is unnecessarily intrusive by extinguishing in legal terms the role of his mother and the maternal family. \n\t  "

A parental order, like an adoption order, has an effect extending far beyond the merely legal.  It has the most profound personal, emotional, psychological, social and, it may be in some cases, cultural and religious, consequences.  It creates what Thorpe LJ in  \n\t     Re J (Adoption: Non-Patrial)  [1998] INLR 424, 429, referred to as 'the psychological relationship of parent and child with all its far-reaching manifestations and consequences.'

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 39 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The next decision is one of Sir James Munby (President of the Family Division as he then was) in  \n\t   Re X (Surrogacy: Time Limit)   [2014] EWHC 3135 (Fam) .  As the case title suggests, the difficulty in that case was that the application for a parental order was made well outside the six month time limit for bringing such an application to the court.  The question for the President was whether the provisions could be read in such a way as to allow an application to proceed out of time.  Sir James Munby took the opportunity to refer to the judgment of Theis J in  A v P  and to add his own further observations in these terms:  \n\t     \n\t   \"58. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If for some reason that is wrong, if that is wrong, if to go that far is in truth to take a step too far, the same conclusion is, in my judgment, amply justified having regard to the Convention. The two key authorities here are the decision of Theis J in  \n\t     A v P  ... and the later decision of the Supreme Court inï¿½ï¿½ Pomiechowski v District Court of Legnica, Poland and another .  Although, as I have pointed out, Theis J founded her analysis on Article 8, whilst the Supreme Court's analysis was based on Article 6, the reasoning in both cases is fundamentally the same: the statute must be 'read down' in such a way as to ensure that the 'essence' of the protected right is not impaired and that what is being protected are rights that are 'practical and effective' and not 'theoretical and illusory'. \n\t     \n\t   \"59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I agree entirely with Theis J's powerful and compelling reasoning. Her focus was on  \n\t     section 54(4) (a) [ HFEA 2008 ], but in my judgment her reasoning applies  mutatis mutandis  with equal force to  section 54(3) . \n\t     \n\t   \"60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I add two things. First, I draw attention to the fact that Theis J was prepared to read down ' and in my judgment correctly prepared to read down '  \n\t     section 54(4) (a) to enable her to make a parental order after one of the commissioning parents had died notwithstanding that  section 54(4) (a), in contrast it may be noted to  section 54(3) , seemingly requires the relevant condition to be satisfied both 'at the time of the application' and 'at the time of ï¿½Ä¶ the making of the order.' If that degree of 'reading down' is permissible in relation to  section 54(4) (a) ' and Theis J held that it was, and I respectfully agree ' then the lesser degree of 'reading down' required in relation to  section 54(3)  is surely  a fortiori . \n\t     \n\t \"61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The other point is this. Theis J focussed on that aspect of Article 8 [of the European Convention] which protects 'family life', but Article 8 also protects 'private life', and 'identity', on which she appropriately laid stress, is an important aspect of 'private life'. So, any application for a parental order implicates both the child's right to 'family life' and also the child's right to 'private life'. The distinction does not matter in the circumstances of the present case (...) but I make the point because it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case where, on the facts, it might be more difficult or even impossible to demonstrate the existence of 'family life'.\" \n\t    "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 54. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   In  \n\t   North West London CCG v GU   [2021] EWCOP 59 , Hayden J provided a comprehensive history of the central position of the concept of 'dignity' in international texts, instruments, and documents in order to evaluate its application to a decision in the Court of Protection concerning the provision of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration and to similarly challenging decisions that the courts are required to make. Hayden J noted that the concept of dignity is, \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   'ï¿½Ä¶ mentioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948, the Preamble to which states that 'recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world', and Article 1 of which provides that 'all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'.' \n\t     \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t     Hayden J set out many other international conventions and documents that refer to the 'inherent dignity of all human beings' or similarly to the requirement to prevent the violation of  'respect for human dignity'. He then concluded at [63] and [64]: \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     'Though it is an ambitious objective to seek to draw from the above texts, drafted in differing jurisdictions and in a variety of contexts, unifying principles underpinning the concept of human dignity, there is a striking thematic consistency. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of what emerges: \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     i. human dignity is predicated on a universal understanding that human beings possess a unique value which is intrinsic to the human condition; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     ii. an individual has an inviolable right to be valued, respected and treated ethically, solely because he/she is a human being; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     iii. human dignity should not be regarded merely as a facet of human rights but as the foundation for them. Logically, it both establishes and substantiates the construction of human rights; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     iv. thus, the protection of human dignity and the rights that flow therefrom is to be regarded as an indispensable priority; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     v. the inherent dignity of a human being imposes an obligation on the State actively to protect the dignity of all human beings. This involves guaranteeing respect for human integrity, fundamental rights and freedoms. Axiomatically, this prescribes the avoidance of discrimination; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     vi. compliance with these principles may result in legitimately diverging opinions as to how best to preserve or promote human dignity, but it does not alter the nature of it nor will it ever obviate the need for rigorous enquiry. \n\t       \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Thus, whilst there is and can be no defining characteristic of human dignity, it is clear that respect for personal autonomy is afforded pre-eminence. Each case will be both situational and person specific. In this respect there is a striking resonance both with the framework of the  \n\t       Mental Capacity Act 2005  and the jurisprudence which underpins it. The forensic approach is 'subjective', in the sense that it requires all involved, family members, treating clinicians, the Courts to conduct an intense focus on the individual at the centre of the process. Frequently, it will involve drilling down into the person's life, considering what he or she may have said or written and a more general evaluation of the code and values by which they have lived their life.'"

It is only when all reasonable steps have been taken to locate her without success that a court is likely to dispense with the need for valid consent.  Half-hearted or token attempts to find the surrogate will not be enough.  Furthermore, it will normally be prudent for the applicants to lay the ground for satisfying these requirements at an early stage.  Even where, as in this case, the applicants do not meet the surrogate, they should establish clear lines of communication with her, preferably not simply through one person or agency, and should ensure that the surrogate is made aware during the pregnancy that she will be required to give consent six weeks after the birth. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   'Secondly, although a consent given before the expiry of six weeks after birth is not valid for the purposes of  \n\t     section 54 , the court is entitled to take into account evidence that the woman did give consent at earlier times to giving up the baby.  The weight attached to such earlier consent is, however, likely to be limited.  The courts must be careful not to use such evidence to undermine the legal requirement that a consent is only valid if given after six weeks. \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   'Thirdly, in the light of the changes affected by the 2010 regulations, the child's welfare is now the paramount consideration when the court is 'coming to a decision' in relation to the making of a parental order.

It is one thing for a DOL order to be made for a child who satisfies the  \n\t   section 25  CA criteria but for whom no secure accommodation can be found.  It is wholly different to make a DOL order for a child that does not satisfy the criteria and where no  section 25  accommodation has ever been looked for. I accept that the only way that the Local Authority can lawfully make arrangements which deprive CC of her liberty is for the Court to make a DOL order exercising the inherent jurisdiction, but as Lady Black acknowledges, that power should only be used if exercising the power does not cut across the statutory scheme under  section 25  CA, and it plainly does here.

Those measures are not identical to  but very similar to those covered by Article 1(2) of Brussels IIA, which also covers guardianship, curatorship and similar institutions, designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's personal property, representing or assistance of the child and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care.  Both of them self-evidently also cover general matters of attribution, exercise, termination or restriction of parental responsibility.

It was, in summary, that the Local Authority considered that it was important for CC to maintain contact with her family and that allowing her to have weekends with her foster parents and aunt was the best way to facilitate this, notwithstanding the increased risks.  Whilst I fully accept that maintaining family contact is important, that does not provide any real answer to the inconsistency of approach.  In my judgment, the Local Authority offered no real answer to the question as to why, if CC was at a real risk of CSE or at risk of violence from others or self-harm, there was no need to put any arrangements in place to protect CC from these risks over the weekends when the risks were far higher.  I do not accept that any logical or proportionate risk analysis could properly conclude that the risks to CC from, in particular, CSE or violence from others meant that she needed to be deprived of her liberty during the week at the Placement but it was acceptable for her to be largely free to do as she wanted in London over the weekend.   \n\t  "

In a comprehensive judgment handed down in January 2022, MacDonald J set aside the order for summary return and allowed the appellant father's appeal against the registration in this jurisdiction of the Russian order directing that their son should live with his mother in Russia \n\t   \n\t\t .  The respondent's appeal against those orders was refused in April 2022.  Some two weeks later, in April 2022, the appellant initiated his current Sch 1 proceedings.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 48. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The expert evidence of Mr Badejo was not challenged.  With respect to the question of whether the children were legally adopted by KN and BN in accordance with Nigerian law (or, more accurately, in accordance with the law of Imo State, matters relating to welfare of children being matters within the legislative competence of the respective State Houses of Assembly in the context of Nigeria's federal system of government) the expert notes the following requirements of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004 that were complied with in this case: \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Section 127 of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004 provides that an application for an adoption order shall be made to the court in the prescribed form.  Whilst the applications forms are not available, having regard to the contents of the social welfare reports the expert considers that the applications to adopt RN and TN were made in the prescribed manner. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Section 127(2) of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004 requires that upon receipt of the application the court shall order an investigation by a child development officer, a supervision officer and such other persons as the court may determine for the purpose of enabling the court to assess the suitability of an applicant as an adopter and the suitability of the child to be adopted. Within this context, albeit undated, social welfare reports were produced pursuant to directions given upon the making of fostering orders on 20 May 2019.  Those reports are mentioned in recitals to the adoption orders that the court took into account the report of the investigation made by the Child Development Officer Ministry of Gender Affairs and Social Development. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Section 127(3) of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004 requires the court, in reaching a decision relating to the adoption of a child, to have regard to all the circumstances first consideration being given to the need to safeguard the welfare and best interest of the child throughout his or her childhood and ascertaining so far as practicable the wishes and feelings of the child regarding the decision  and giving due consideration to those wishes and feelings having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  Mr Badejo notes that the adoption orders in respect of both children state that the court was satisfied with respect to the best interests and welfare of the children. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Section 130(d) of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004 provides that the adopter or adopters shall be persons found suitable to adopt the child in question by the appropriate investigating officers. Mr Badejo considers that the issue of the suitability of KN and BN as adopters is addressed in the welfare reports which were before the court and that therefore this requirement under the law of Imo State was satisfied on the evidence. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   With respect to the age and residency requirements in s. 132(1) of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004, Mr Badejo considers that KN and BN each met the age requirements.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   With respect to the requirement to residence in Imo State, Mr Badejo opines that the fact that the parents in this case were residing in England at the time when the adoption order was made will not preclude them from being regarded under the law of Imo State as resident in the husband's ancestral family home in Imo State for a period of five years, the same state as the children's residence at the material time.  In this regard, Mr Badejo cites the English case of  \n\t     Re X (Recognition of Foreign Adoption)   [2021] EWHC 355 (Fam)  as being persuasive authority in Nigeria in the absence of Nigerian authority on the point.   \n\t     \n\t   vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   With respect to the requirement for the children to have been in the physical care of KN and BN for a period of 3 months prior to the adoption order being made, whilst the children were in the care of the parents for only 14 days between 20 May 2019 and 3 June 2019, Mr Badejo considers that the English case of  \n\t     Re V (A Child)(Recognition of Foreign Adoption)  [2017] EWHC 1733 (Fam)  is persuasive authority in Nigeria in the absence of Nigerian authority on the point.  In this context, Mr Badejo opines that the evidence that the parents had sole responsibility for decisions on the children's upbringing and welfare needs is sufficient to meet the care requirement under the Imo State legislation. \n\t     \n\t viii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The welfare reports each state that the parents had made their intent to adopt known by an application on 8 March 2018, satisfying the requirement of s. 131(1)(f) of the Child Rights Law Imo State 2004. \n\t    "

There Peter Jackson LJ held at [89]: \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'The principles governing decisions (by local authorities as adoption agencies or by the court) as to whether a putative father or a relative should be informed of the existence of a child who might be adopted can be summarised in this way. \n\t     \n\t   (1) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The law allows for 'fast-track adoption' with the consent of all those with parental responsibility, so in some cases the mother alone. Where she opposes notification being given to the child's father or relatives her right to respect for her private life is engaged and can only be infringed where it is necessary to do so to protect the interests of others. \n\t     \n\t   (2) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The profound importance of the adoption decision for the child and potentially for other family members is clearly capable of supplying a justification for overriding the mother's request.

The confidential relinquishment of a child for adoption is an unusual event and the reasons for it must be respectfully scrutinised so that the interests of others are protected. In fairness to those other individuals, the account that is given by the person seeking confidentiality cannot be taken at face value. All information that can be discovered without compromising confidentiality should therefore be gathered and a first-hand account from the person seeking confidentiality will normally be sought. The investigation should enable broad conclusions to be drawn about the relative weight to be given to the factors that must inform the decision. \n\t     \n\t   (5) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Once the facts have been investigated the task is to strike a fair balance between the various interests involved. The welfare of the child is an important factor but it is not the paramount consideration. \n\t     \n\t   (6) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     There is no single test for distinguishing between cases in which notification should and should not be given but the case law shows that these factors will be relevant when reaching a decision: \n\t     \n\t   (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Parental responsibility. The fact that a father has parental responsibility by marriage or otherwise entitles him to give or withhold consent to adoption and gives him automatic party status in any proceedings that might lead to adoption. Compelling reasons are therefore required before the withholding of notification can be justified. \n\t     \n\t   (ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Article 8 rights. Whether the father, married or unmarried, or the relative have an established or potential family life with the mother or the child, the right to a fair hearing is engaged and strong reasons are required before the withholding of notification can be justified. \n\t     \n\t   (iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The substance of the relationships. Aside from the presence or absence of parental responsibility and of family life rights, an assessment must be made of the substance of the relationship between the parents, the circumstances of the conception, and the significance of relatives. The purpose is to ensure that those who are necessarily silent are given a notional voice so as to identify the possible strengths and weaknesses of any argument that they might make. Put another way, with what degree of objective justification might such a person complain if they later discovered they had been excluded from the decision? The answer will differ as between a father with whom the mother has had a fleeting encounter and one with whom she has had a substantial relationship, and as between members of the extended family who are close to the parents and those who are more distant. \n\t     \n\t   (iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The likelihood of a family placement being a realistic alternative to adoption. This is of particular importance to the child's lifelong welfare as it may determine whether or not adoption is necessary. An objective view, going beyond the say-so of the person seeking confidentiality, should be taken about whether a family member may or may not be a potential carer. Where a family placement is unlikely to be worth investigating or where notification may cause significant harm to those notified, this factor will speak in favour of maintaining confidentiality; anything less than that and it will point the other way. \n\t     \n\t   (v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The physical, psychological or social impact on the mother or on others of notification being given. Where this would be severe, for example because of fear arising from rape or violence, or because of possible consequences such as ostracism or family breakdown, or because of significant mental health vulnerability, these must weigh heavily in the balancing exercise. On the other hand, excessive weight should not be given to short term difficulties and to less serious situations involving embarrassment or social unpleasantness, otherwise the mothers wish would always prevail at the expense of other interests. \n\t     \n\t   (vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Cultural and religious factors. The conception and concealed pregnancy may give rise to particular difficulties in some cultural and religious contexts. These may enhance the risks of notification, but they may also mean that the possibility of maintaining the birth tie through a family placement is of particular importance for the child. \n\t     \n\t   (vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The availability and durability of the confidential information. Notification can only take place if there is someone to notify. In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child's existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind. \n\t     \n\t   (viii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The impact of delay. A decision to apply to court and thereafter any decision to notify will inevitably postpone to some extent the time when the child's permanent placement can be confirmed. In most cases, the importance of the issues means that the delay cannot be a predominant factor. There may however be circumstances where delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother or for the child; for example, it would undoubtedly need to be taken into account if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child's established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement. \n\t     \n\t   (ix) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Any other relevant matters. The list of relevant factors is not closed. Mothers may have many reasons for wishing to maintain confidentiality and there may be a wide range of implications for the child, the father and for other relatives. All relevant matters must be considered. \n\t     \n\t (7) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It has rightly been said that the maintenance of confidentiality is exceptional, and highly exceptional where a father has parental responsibility or where there is family life under article 8. However exceptionality is not in itself a test or a short cut; rather it is a reflection of the fact that the profound significance of adoption for the child and considerations of fairness to others means that the balance will often fall in favour of notification. But the decision on whether confidentiality should be maintained can only be made by striking a fair balance between the factors that are present in the individual case.'"

Indeed in family cases, where the question is not only 'what happened in the past?' but also 'what may happen in the future?', a witness's demeanour may offer important information to the court about what sort of a person the witness truly is, and consequently whether an account of past events or future intentions is likely to be reliable'"

This surely was the point being made, and correctly underscored, by Sir James Munby. It seems to me that it is for this reason that Sir Andrew McFarlane P emphasised that an application for anonymisation of a group of professionals involved in particular case must 'turn on its own facts' \n\t\t .  For this very reason it seems to me \n\t       that Sir Andrew McFarlane P is not saying at para 21 of his Amended Guidance dated 26 January 2023 for those taking part in the (very welcome) Transparency Pilot, that without any serious consideration of the facts of the case in hand, all social workers, all Cafcass reporting officers and all Guardians should,  as generic classes , 'normally' or 'usually' should have their identities withheld. Rather, he must be referring to the truism that naming them may well increase the risk of identification of the children and so, for that special reason, anonymisation may well be necessary on the facts of the individual case."

Its focus, as  \n\t   Re R  and  Re H-N  made clear, is to determine how the parents of a child behaved towards each other so as to be able properly to assess risk and determine the welfare issues in each case. I note that Parliament recently passed the  Domestic Abuse Act 2021  and, in so doing, expressly replicated in the family court some provisions applicable in the criminal courts, for example, in relation to cross-examination by litigants in person. However, Parliament declined to legislate for a framework in the family court within which to determine allegations of rape and sexual assault: it was not invited to do so during the passage of  the Act . In those circumstances, it is difficult to conceive that this court might now attempt to do so."

Applying criminal definitions narrows the court's focus inappropriately away from the wider consideration of family relationships at play in a fact-finding hearing. In  Re R , albeit in the context of findings of  'murder'  or  'manslaughter' , McFarlane LJ identified at [62] the scope and purpose of a fact-finding hearing in the family court as follows: \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'The focus and purpose of a fact-finding investigation in the context of a case concerning the future welfare of children in the Family Court are wholly different to those applicable to the prosecution by the State of an individual before a Criminal Court.

It is his submission that the interpretation of Article 10 is not  \n\t   Acte Claire  despite and although the Court of Appeal has reached a conclusion on the application of Article 10 in  Re H (children) (Reunite International Child Abduction Center Intervening) [2014] EWCA Civ1101 . It is Mr JarmanÄôs submission that Mr Justice Mosytn, in a case which has since submissions were delivered been made available to me, has made a referral to the CJEU in relation to the interpretation of Article 10 in a case involving a non-member state. I may not therefore he submits proceed to make orders on the basis of a retained Article 10 jurisdiction where the children in this case have been removed to/retained in a non-member state until such time as the CJEU has reached a decision on the reference made by Mr Justice Mostyn. I recognise that Mr Jarman seeks to raise there a novel legal argument. I adopt the straightforward approach commended to me on behalf of the Mother by Mr Perkins that as the authorities are currently configured the Court of Appeal decision is binding. That a first instance judge has, in an unrelated case, instigated a referral does not alter that state of affairs. Nor does it require me to await, and delay yet further a decision in this case, the outcome of the referral. If I have understood correctly Mr JarmanÄôs submission, the logical end point of it is that no case in which there is a wrongful retention to a non-member state could conclude following the referral to the CJEU by Mostyn J or, to put it another way all such cases must grind to a halt pending determination of the CJEU referral. I have considered Mr JarmanÄôs submission on this point Äì both as to the wider logical consequence of it and as to the effect in the circumstances of this case Äì and I reject it and the submission that Article 10 is not engaged. I turn therefore to consider the question of Habitual Residence, where, as I am satisfied, Article 10 is engaged. "

(5) Where a court is considering whether or not to make one or more orders under this Act with respect to a child, it shall not make the order or any of the orders unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 33 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   In this case I drew great assistance from two decisions. They shape and inform how a court should approach the question of the summary return order under the inherent jurisdiction.  \n\t   Re  J (Custody Right: Jurisdiction)  [2005] UKHL 40 and, as I have indicated:  In the matter of NY (A Child)   [2019] UKSC 49 . Overall, the law that governs this question is well established. It can be distilled into the following eight principles. I will detail each of them, before I return to  Re J  and  NY,  in a little more detail. \n\t     \n\t   (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Paramountcy . I want to make it clear that the paramountcy principle informs everything that this court does in respect of this application. The welfare of L and Q is the court's paramount consideration, which means nothing supplants it. \n\t     \n\t   (ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The test . The test is the best welfare interests of the child. \n\t     \n\t   (iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The focus of the welfare question . The issue is not to do with the range of options about who the children should live with, or the levels of contact or long term arrangements for them. It is much more tightly focused. It is simply this: is summary return in the best welfare interests of the child. But this issue can be further refined with a codicil to the issue that the summary return is because the court in the receiving jurisdiction is best placed to make decisions about the best arrangements for the child's short-term, medium-term and long-term future ( In the matter of   KL  in the Supreme Court). To answer that question there must necessarily be a welfare analysis.  \n\t     \n\t   (iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The finding of wrongful retention does not mean that there must be automatic return. There must be a welfare evaluation to decide whether the return is in the welfare interests of the child. I will come to the intensity of that welfare scrutiny shortly.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The application here, under the inherent jurisdiction, is a route to determining the issue of summary return. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whether the welfare analysis were under a specific issue order for the purposes of  \n\t     section 8  of the  Children Act 1989  or the inherent jurisdiction the principles are the same.  \n\t     \n\t   (vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The function of the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction is to promote and safeguard the welfare of the children. This is clear from the historical origins of the inherent jurisdiction as I have demonstrated. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t (viii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst  \n\t     In the matter of NY  involved the court considering an outward return order, Mostyn J in  Re N   [2020] EWFC 35  concluded that the principles set out in  NY  apply equally to applications for an inward return order, as is sought by Mr PT here.

Regular video contact is beneficial but continuing direct contact with her father is also essential to AÄôs welfare. Contact with the father will also help to ensure that she can gain knowledge and experience, as she matures, in the Muslim faith. This is part of her heritage and it is in her interests to know about it. I must take into account AÄôs age, sex, background and any characteristics of which I consider relevant: the Muslim faith of her father is an important aspect of her background and relocation to Slovakia would tend to weaken rather than strengthen that link to his Muslim faith even if the father takes steps to teach A about it as she grows during contact or even on holidays to Algeria in the future.  \n\t  "

(4) A direction under this section may be made by the court' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the party in relation to the witness; (e) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the witness in relation to the party; (f) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (g) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (h) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (i) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (j) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party.

(3) The court may revoke a direction under section 85I on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since' (a) the direction was given, or (b) if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. (4) The court must state its reasons for' (a) giving a direction under section 85I; (b) refusing an application for a direction under section 85I; (c) revoking a direction under section 85I; (d) refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 85I. 85K Alternatives to cross-examination in person (1) This section applies where a party to civil proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 85F to 85I. (2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. (5) The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. (6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party.

But the use of puberty blockers is not itself a neutral process by which time stands still for the child on PBs, whether physically or psychologically. PBs prevent the child going through puberty in the normal biological process. As a minimum it seems to us that this means that the child is not undergoing the physical and consequential psychological changes which would contribute to the understanding of a personÄôs identity. There is an argument that for some children at least, this may confirm the childÄôs chosen gender identity at the time they begin the use of puberty blockers and to that extent, confirm their GD and increase the likelihood of some children moving on to cross-sex hormones. Indeed, the statistical correlation between the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones supports the case that it is appropriate to view PBs as a stepping stone to cross-sex hormones.Äù "

Further provision about orders 63D Ex parte orders: Part 4A (1) The court may, in any case where it considers that it is just and convenient to do so, make a forced marriage protection order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances including' (a) any risk of significant harm to the person to be protected or another person if the order is not made immediately; (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately; and (c) whether there is reason to believe that' (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service; and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the person to be protected or (if a different person) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about any order made by virtue of subsection (1).

(4) Section 63E applies to proceedings for a variation of a forced marriage protection order as it applies to proceedings for the making of such an order.

However, the source or nature of information that a person is threatened with forced marriage may itself require protection. There may be good grounds not to disclose that material to the child's parents or to others who are subject to restrictions imposed by a Forced Marriage Protection Order. When such material is withheld, how should the court manage hearings at which a Forced Marriage Protection Order is challenged? In this judgment I set out my reasons for sanctioning the appointment of a Special Advocate to represent the interests of the respondent father. Such appointments will be rare in the family justice system but they merit careful consideration in Forced Marriage Protection Order applications where the applicant relies on material that cannot be disclosed to a Respondent but the respondent challenges the justification for the order and applies to have it discharged.  \n\t  "

If she had consented, there would be no deprivation of her liberty (see paragraph 74 of Storck).  In  \n\t   Lincolnshire County Council v TGA & Ors    Lieven J decided that, where a child did not have capacity to make the decision for himself, it was within the  [2022] EWHC 2323 (Fam) 'zone of parental responsibility'  to be able to approve arrangements which deprived a child of his liberty.  However, that principle would not apply here because CC can make her own decisions.  There is a difficult issue as to the extent to which parents retain the power to make decisions on behalf of children who have capacity.  That issue was explored by Lieven J in  AB v CD & Ors   .  In relation to medical treatment, Lieven J said  [2021] EWHC 741 (Fam) 'The very essence of Gillick is, in my view, that a parent's right to consent or \"determine\" treatment cannot trump or overbear the decision of the child' .   In the  Lincolnshire  case Lieven J said that the same approach to parental responsibilities should be taken in relation to deprivation of liberty as in relation to medical treatment.  I agree with both judgments.  Thus, it seems to me, the Local Authority were right to bring this case on the basis that the court's approval was needed because, faced with objections from a 15 year old with capacity to make her own decisions, the Local Authority could not rely on having parental responsibility to justify depriving CC of her liberty.  I thus accept that there is no proper consent in place and that, as the arrangements persist for the period from Monday to Friday, CC is being deprived of her liberty."

In other words, the Court of Appeal was acknowledging the significance of the rule change in 2009 and identifying the essential task for the court as being ' and this in a case where the issue was whether or not there should be anonymisation ' to undertake the balancing exercise mandated by the Convention. The ratio of the decision was that both the first instance and appeal judgments would be published without anonymity, in particular because, having undertaken the balancing exercise, the husband had behaved badly. The general practice favouring anonymisation was not an essential reason for the decision; on the contrary that practice was of no relevance to the specific facts of that case which in the final analysis, were decisive. Those specific facts meant that anonymisation would not be applied.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   The irony of all this will not have escaped the reader. In both  \n\t     Clibbery v Allan  and  Lykiardopulo v Lykiardopulo , the decisions of the Court of Appeal most frequently cited in support of the conventional pieties, the actual ratio was that proposed prohibition of publication or anonymisation is to be resolved having regard to and balancing the interests of the parties and the public as protected by Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention, considered in the particular circumstances of the case.'"

That class is of course financial remedy proceedings as practised in the modern era, a class of case which was unknown in Lord Blanesburgh's day. After all, such a silver-tongued advocate would plead: 'we have always done it this way'. But it is for the very reason that such blatant wrongness can be so artfully justified that the principle of open justice should be affirmed most trenchantly in financial remedy proceedings and anonymisation only allowed in unusual or exceptional circumstances. Those circumstances are where the weighing exercise shows such an imbalance that it can be safely be said that there is a 'compelling justification', and that it is 'strictly necessary', for there to be a departure from the normal rule of full reporting."

Those submissions would likely (a) have directed him to the relevant case law relating to the disclosure of information from family proceedings to professional regulatory bodies, particularly those bodies with a statutory duty to protect the public; (b) have reminded him that SWE was a statutory body with an obligation to protect the public and to ensure that social workers were fit to practise; (c) drawn his attention to the applicability of the  \n\t   Re C  factors when the welfare of vulnerable adults was at stake; and (d) reminded the judge that disclosure could be ordered subject to certain safeguards such as (i) the anonymisation of the child's name and that of her mother or (ii) an order prohibiting anything in SWE's regulatory process which might either disclose Z's name or lead to her identification to the world at large. In making these observations, I am mindful of and very sympathetic to the huge pressures on judges dealing with the more difficult and sensitive family cases. These cases are often complicated by the fact that parents may be representing themselves and thus, when a significant legal issue arises, they are unable to draw the judge's attention to the relevant case law.

The fact that a judge rightly concludes that a case is a 'needs' case does not mean that the judge must then make an order that satisfies both parties' needs.  In one sense, this is obvious, because there may simply be insufficient assets to satisfy the needs of either party, let alone both.    I take the view, however, that it goes further than that.  There will be many cases where there are sufficient assets to meet both parties needs and it is undoubtedly right to do so, even if that means invading non-matrimonial property.  There will, however, be a different category of case where the assets may only be barely sufficient to do so or, potentially, not sufficient.  These are the most difficult cases and this case is one of those.   \n\t  "

In the later judgment of Hayden J in  Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust v H   [2022] EWFC 14 , the court was faced with opinion evidence that it was unlikely, but not impossible, that H experienced discomfort, pain or pleasure at some level. Hayden J held, \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   'I do not consider that civil test has application in this situation. I would go further, I consider it would be quite wrong, when balancing the difficult and sensitive issues raised here, not to take account of the fact that treatment might be causing H pain. In this case, as I have set out above, the situation is further complicated by the fact that Dr Lumsden agrees that it is likely that H periodically experiences some kind of 'primitive pain' reaction and discomfort. Dr Lumsden states that this is not to be equated with the pain that a sentient adult might experience. The civil standard of proof test i.e., the balance of probabilities, certainly requires to be applied in particular, and prescribed circumstances. In this context, however, i.e., in an investigative, non-adversarial, sui generis process, such a constricted approach lacks the necessary nuance. It is medically impossible to exclude the possibility of pain in H's case. There is no test, there can be, in the case of a young child, no formal assessment. The conclusions reached are based on observations alone to establish a negative i.e., what is thought not to be there. It is trite to say that this is a delicate and sensitive process. The Court's finding should reflect nothing more and nothing less than that reality when it is evaluating those factors that illuminate H's best interests. Where the doctors cannot exclude the possibility of pain, neither should the Judge.'  \n\t    "

Within this context, there is in my judgment a stark difference between a provider who makes an application and fails in the first instance (the chances of which can be significantly reduced by working in partnership with and taking advice from Ofsted once the application has been submitted) and the provider who refuses to apply or cannot apply. In the former situation, an attempt has been made to bring the child back within the regulatory regime mandated by Parliament, albeit that attempt has been unsuccessful. In such circumstances, the regulator has had a chance to consider the placement and the court must factor in the result when determining for the purposes of the Practice Guidance whether the placement of the child in the unregistered childrenÄôs home or unregistered care home service continues to be in the childÄôs best interests, and in particular whether, on the advice of the regulator, changes can be made to ensure a successful registration application in due course. In the latter situation, there has not even been an  \n\t   attempt  to bring the child within the statutory regulatory regime, notwithstanding that that is what the law requires, with no opportunity for the independent regulator to consider the placement (because no application is made) and with the result that the child remains outside the statutory regulatory regime for the duration of the placement."

Such a refusal by a provider is, in reality, a statement of intent not to comply with the law put in place by Parliament to safeguard and promote the welfare of the subject child through the imposition of a comprehensive and wide ranging regulatory regime. Given the burden placed on providers by an application for registration, such a position on the part of the provider  \n\t   may  be understandable if the provider does not ordinarily make such provision, for example a private landlord, the owner of a holiday park or other venue not ordinarily involved in social care. However, it is placements in this category that are most likely to result in a wholly unsuitable placement for obvious reasons. Within this context, a refusal by a provider to apply for registration immediately following a placement deprives the child for the duration of that placement of regulatory oversight where it is arguably  most  needed. In the context of the cases before the court, the local authority considers that the placement for QV, a holiday park, will not consent to an application being made to Ofsted for registration."

There is no definition of 'father' in the  CA 1989 . Mr Kingerley and Ms Carew jointly submit that the father must in fact and in law be the father to be able to take advantage of this route to obtaining parental responsibility. In this case, it is established pursuant to the relevant provisions of the  HFEA 2008 , outlined above, that PA is not the legal father therefore the inclusion of his name on the birth certificate as the father cannot be correct in the light of the court's declaration. It follows, therefore, if he is not the father he does not have parental responsibility because  section 4   CA 1989  does not apply (to an individual who is not the father). Although not directly relevant to the application this court is being asked to determine, those submissions make logical sense and I accept their analysis.' \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Williams J took a similar view on the issue of acquisition of parental responsibility by approaching the issue on the assumption that removal of the mother's name from the birth certificate would result in the loss of parental responsibility,  Re G (Declaration of Parentage: Removal of Person Identified as Mother from Birth Certificate) (No 1)   [2018] EWHC 3379 (Fam) .

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 89. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t With respect to providers that ÄúcannotÄù apply for registration, on behalf of Ofsted Ms Clement submitted that Ofsted does not recognise such a category, any person carrying on or managing a childrenÄôs home being required to apply for registration and any other placement not requiring registration because it is not a childrenÄôs home. Within this context, Ofsted contend that there is no such category of placements that ÄúcannotÄù apply for registration. There is considerable force in that submission. However, in so far as a provider determines not to apply for registration because it could, for example, never meet the requirements to successfully apply, the court will be left in a similar position to that it finds itself in in respect of providers that will not apply. Once again, the child would be left outside the statutory regulatory regime for the duration of the placement as an application to Ofsted would never be made. Once again, this is not likely to be in the subject childÄôs best interests for the reasons set out above. If there are no steps being taken to regularise the position by applying for registration contrary to the Practice Guidance, the placement cannot be brought back at any point within the regulatory regime that Parliament has determined is required to meet the childÄôs needs. The inherent jurisdiction should not be used in circumstances which lead to the perpetuation of such an outcome. Again, the court may be required to make a very short order (measured in days and not weeks) to hold the ring whilst alternative arrangements are put in place, particularly where a placement is required immediately in order to meet the operational duties under Art 2 of Art 3 of the ECHR by keeping the child safe. \n\t  "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 91. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t Where there is a continued failure to prosecute an application for registration despite a stated intent to do so it is difficult to see how court could continue, indefinitely, to use its inherent jurisdiction to authorise the deprivation of liberty in such a setting, as this would leave the subject child outside the protection of the statutory regime and would be contrary to the legislative intent underpinning the statutory regime. It is plainly unsatisfactory for a child to be in an unregistered placement very for months after it was known that he or she has been placed there. Such an approach increases the risk that a child will be moved into an unregistered placement and then moved again before the application to register is made, the completion of the registration process always lagging behind the child. This is not consistent with strict compliance with the Practice Guidance. Further, as Ms Clement points out, the granting of a declaration authorising the deprivation of the childÄôs liberty does not act to abrogate the continuing duty of the local authority under  \n\t   the 1989 Act  to safeguard and promote the childÄôs welfare under  section 22(3)  of  the 1989 Act , and to provide the child with accommodation which meets the childÄôs needs in accordance with  section 22 C of  the 1989 Act . Where that accommodation is in a placement operated as a childrenÄôs home, it must be the subject of an application for registration. Whilst there is delay in applying for registration there is no independent review of placement or care of child or qualifications or training. Within the foregoing context, if a provider fails to apply for registration in a timely manner, and if a local authority fails to require that they do so, they must expect at some point that the court will refuse to continue authorising the deprivation of liberty of very vulnerable outside of the regulatory regime carefully designed by Parliament to protect and safeguard them."

In the former situation, an attempt has been made to bring the child back within the regulatory regime mandated by Parliament, albeit that attempt has been unsuccessful. In such circumstances, the regulator has had a chance to consider the placement and the court must factor in the result when determining for the purposes of the Practice Guidance whether the placement of the child in the unregistered childrenÄôs home or unregistered care home service continues to be in the childÄôs best interests, and in particular whether, on the advice of the regulator, changes can be made to ensure a successful registration application in due course. In the latter situation, there has not even been an  \n\t   attempt  to bring the child within the statutory regulatory regime, notwithstanding that that is what the law requires, with no opportunity for the independent regulator to consider the placement (because no application is made) and with the result that the child remains outside the statutory regulatory regime for the duration of the placement."

The new scientific techniques which have developed since the birth of the first IVF baby in 1978 open up the possibility of creating human life in ways and circumstances quite different from anything experienced before then. These possibilities bring with them huge practical and ethical difficulties. These have to be balanced against the strength and depth of the feelings of people who desperately long for the children which only these techniques can give them, as well as the natural desire of clinicians and scientists to use their skills to fulfil those wishes. Parliament has devised a legislative scheme and a statutory authority for regulating assisted reproduction in a way which tries to strike a fair balance between the various interests and concerns. Centres, the HFEA and the courts have to respect that scheme, however great their sympathy for the plight of particular individuals caught up in it.\""

(5) In placing a child for adoption, an adoption agency in Wales must give due consideration to the childÄôs religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background.

The passage of time simply reinforced that view. I quite understand that it attempted to assist the Mother at an immensely difficult time for her, and has throughout been guided by what it believe is in the interests of W, but in my view there has been a loss of focus. In particular, the Local Authority did not sufficiently appreciate the importance of the notification issue,  \n\t     Cases A, B and C,  and the competing rights and interests of the Mother, W, the Father, and wider families. ii) The evidence presented about the Father is limited, but in my view, even on the MotherÄôs presentation, it is not sufficient for him to be excluded on a summary basis from being a possible carer, or if not a carer, from playing some other more limited role in WÄôs life. The concerns raised by the Mother are not of such gravity as to remove him entirely from the equation now. It seems to me that in the circumstances of this case to proceed to adoption (the Äúlast resortÄù/Äùwhere nothing else will doÄù as it was described in  Re B  (Care Proceedings: Appeal)  )) without (a) conducting a thorough inquiry into his circumstances and (b) permitting him to advance a case as to how he might make a meaningful contribution in WÄôs life and (c) permitting him to put forward options which fall short of adoption, would be disproportionate and unjust. iii) [2013] UKSC 33 Similarly, I do not consider that the evidence justifies either the maternal grandparents or (conceivably, albeit rather less likely) the paternal grandparents being summarily excluded from consideration at this stage, whether as carers or as people whom W should have the opportunity of seeing, and with whom he may benefit from developing a relationship. iv) The MotherÄôs relationship with her parents, in particular her mother, does not appear to be irredeemably broken down. She told the Guardian that had she known how these 10 months would unfold, she would have had the company of her mother at the birth. I have also been told that during lockdown the Mother lived with her parents, albeit because her tenancy had come to an end. These are positive relationship indicators. "

There Peter Jackson LJ held at [89]: \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     'The principles governing decisions (by local authorities as adoption agencies or by the court) as to whether a putative father or a relative should be informed of the existence of a child who might be adopted can be summarised in this way. \n\t     \n\t   (1) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The law allows for 'fast-track adoption' with the consent of all those with parental responsibility, so in some cases the mother alone.

In fairness to those other individuals, the account that is given by the person seeking confidentiality cannot be taken at face value. All information that can be discovered without compromising confidentiality should therefore be gathered and a first-hand account from the person seeking confidentiality will normally be sought. The investigation should enable broad conclusions to be drawn about the relative weight to be given to the factors that must inform the decision. \n\t     \n\t   (5) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Once the facts have been investigated the task is to strike a fair balance between the various interests involved. The welfare of the child is an important factor but it is not the paramount consideration. \n\t     \n\t   (6) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     There is no single test for distinguishing between cases in which notification should and should not be given but the case law shows that these factors will be relevant when reaching a decision: \n\t     \n\t   (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Parental responsibility. The fact that a father has parental responsibility by marriage or otherwise entitles him to give or withhold consent to adoption and gives him automatic party status in any proceedings that might lead to adoption. Compelling reasons are therefore required before the withholding of notification can be justified. \n\t     \n\t   (ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Article 8 rights. Whether the father, married or unmarried, or the relative have an established or potential family life with the mother or the child, the right to a fair hearing is engaged and strong reasons are required before the withholding of notification can be justified. \n\t     \n\t   (iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The substance of the relationships. Aside from the presence or absence of parental responsibility and of family life rights, an assessment must be made of the substance of the relationship between the parents, the circumstances of the conception, and the significance of relatives. The purpose is to ensure that those who are necessarily silent are given a notional voice so as to identify the possible strengths and weaknesses of any argument that they might make. Put another way, with what degree of objective justification might such a person complain if they later discovered they had been excluded from the decision? The answer will differ as between a father with whom the mother has had a fleeting encounter and one with whom she has had a substantial relationship, and as between members of the extended family who are close to the parents and those who are more distant. \n\t     \n\t   (iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The likelihood of a family placement being a realistic alternative to adoption. This is of particular importance to the child's lifelong welfare as it may determine whether or not adoption is necessary. An objective view, going beyond the say-so of the person seeking confidentiality, should be taken about whether a family member may or may not be a potential carer. Where a family placement is unlikely to be worth investigating or where notification may cause significant harm to those notified, this factor will speak in favour of maintaining confidentiality; anything less than that and it will point the other way. \n\t     \n\t   (v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The physical, psychological or social impact on the mother or on others of notification being given. Where this would be severe, for example because of fear arising from rape or violence, or because of possible consequences such as ostracism or family breakdown, or because of significant mental health vulnerability, these must weigh heavily in the balancing exercise. On the other hand, excessive weight should not be given to short term difficulties and to less serious situations involving embarrassment or social unpleasantness, otherwise the mothers wish would always prevail at the expense of other interests. \n\t     \n\t   (vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Cultural and religious factors. The conception and concealed pregnancy may give rise to particular difficulties in some cultural and religious contexts. These may enhance the risks of notification, but they may also mean that the possibility of maintaining the birth tie through a family placement is of particular importance for the child. \n\t     \n\t   (vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The availability and durability of the confidential information. Notification can only take place if there is someone to notify. In cases where a mother declines to identify a father she may face persuasion, if that is thought appropriate, but she cannot be coerced. In some cases the available information may mean that the father is identifiable, and maternal relatives may also be identifiable. The extent to which identifying information is pursued is a matter of judgement. Conversely, there will be cases where it is necessary to consider whether any confidentiality is likely to endure. In the modern world secrets are increasingly difficult to keep and the consequences, particularly for the child and any prospective adopters, of the child's existence being concealed but becoming known to family members later on, sometimes as a result of disclosure by the person seeking confidentiality, should be borne in mind. \n\t     \n\t   (viii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The impact of delay. A decision to apply to court and thereafter any decision to notify will inevitably postpone to some extent the time when the child's permanent placement can be confirmed. In most cases, the importance of the issues means that the delay cannot be a predominant factor. There may however be circumstances where delay would have particularly damaging consequences for the mother or for the child; for example, it would undoubtedly need to be taken into account if it would lead to the withdrawal of the child's established carers or to the loss of an especially suitable adoptive placement. \n\t     \n\t   (ix) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Any other relevant matters. The list of relevant factors is not closed. Mothers may have many reasons for wishing to maintain confidentiality and there may be a wide range of implications for the child, the father and for other relatives. All relevant matters must be considered. \n\t     \n\t (7) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It has rightly been said that the maintenance of confidentiality is exceptional, and highly exceptional where a father has parental responsibility or where there is family life under article 8. However exceptionality is not in itself a test or a short cut; rather it is a reflection of the fact that the profound significance of adoption for the child and considerations of fairness to others means that the balance will often fall in favour of notification. But the decision on whether confidentiality should be maintained can only be made by striking a fair balance between the factors that are present in the individual case.'"

These are, first, that the adoptive parent must have been domiciled in the relevant foreign country at the time of the foreign adoption; second, that the child must have been legally adopted in accordance with the requirements of the law of that state; third, that the foreign adoption must in substance have the same essential characteristics as an English adoption; and fourth and finally, that there must be no reason in public policy for refusing recognition.

(4) Regulations under subsection (3) may provide that any evidence which satisfies the court that domestic abuse, or domestic abuse of a specified description, has occurred is specified evidence for the purposes of this section. 31U Direction for prohibition of cross-examination in person: other cases (1) In family proceedings, the court may give a direction prohibiting a party to the proceedings from cross-examining (or continuing to cross-examine) a witness in person if' (a) none of sections 31R to 31T operates to prevent the party from cross-examining the witness, and (b) it appears to the court that' (i) the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met, and (ii) it would not be contrary to the interests of justice to give the direction. (2) The 'quality condition' is met if the quality of evidence given by the witness on cross-examination' (a) is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) is conducted by the party in person, and (b) would be likely to be improved if a direction were given under this section. (3) The 'significant distress condition' is met if' (a) the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) of the witness by the party in person would be likely to cause significant distress to the witness or the party, and (b) that distress is likely to be more significant than would be the case if the witness were cross-examined other than by the party in person. (4) A direction under this section may be made by the court' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (e) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (f) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (g) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (h) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party. (6) Any reference in this section to the quality of a witness's evidence is to its quality in terms of completeness, coherence and accuracy. (7) For this purpose ' coherence ' refers to a witness's ability in giving evidence to give answers which' (a) address the questions put to the witness, and (b) can be understood, both individually and collectively. 31V Directions under section 31U: supplementary (1) A direction under section 31U has binding effect from the time it is made until the witness in relation to whom it applies is discharged. (2) But the court may revoke a direction under section 31U before the witness is discharged, if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so, either' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (3) The court may revoke a direction under section 31U on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since' (a) the direction was given, or (b) if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. (4) The court must state its reasons for' (a) giving a direction under section 31U; (b) refusing an application for a direction under section 31U; (c) revoking a direction under section 31U; (d) refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 31U. 31W Alternatives to cross-examination in person (1) This section applies where a party to family proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 31R to 31U. (2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. (5) The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. (6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party. (7) A qualified legal representative appointed by the court under subsection (6) is not responsible to the party. (8) For the purposes of this section' (a) a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; (b) ' qualified legal representative ' means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in family proceedings. 31X Costs of legal representatives appointed under section 31W(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision for the payment out of central funds of sums in respect of' (a) fees or costs properly incurred by a qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6), and (b) expenses properly incurred in providing such a person with evidence or other material in connection with the appointment. (2) The regulations may provide for sums payable under subsection (1) to be determined by the Lord Chancellor or such other person as the regulations may specify. (3) The regulations may provide for sums payable under subsection (1)' (a) to be such amounts as are specified in the regulations; (b) to be calculated in accordance with' (i) a rate or scale specified in the regulations, or (ii) other provision made by or under the regulations. 31Y Guidance for legal representatives appointed under section 31W(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may issue guidance in connection with the role which a qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6) in connection with any family proceedings is to play in the proceedings, including (among other things) guidance about the effect of section 31W(7). (2) A qualified legal representative appointed under section 31W(6) must have regard to any guidance issued under this section. (3) The Lord Chancellor may from time to time revise any guidance issued under this section. (4) The Lord Chancellor must publish' (a) any guidance issued under this section, and (b) any revisions of that guidance. 31Z Regulations under Part 4B (1) Any power of the Lord Chancellor to make regulations under this Part' (a) is exercisable by statutory instrument, (b) includes power to make different provision for different purposes, and (c) includes power to make supplementary, incidental, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision. (2) A statutory instrument containing regulations under this Part is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament." ] ,

Memory becomes fainter with every day that passes and the imagination becomes correspondingly more active. Thus, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance (see [29]-[30] of  \n\t     A County Council v M and F   [2012] 2 FLR 939 )."

A s  the position of each of the parties has crystalised, the provisions of   s38(6)  of  the Act  have gained greater prevalence. For entirely correct reasons, it is common ground that the placement is a residential family centre that falls within the definition of the 2004 Act. As such it must be registered with Ofsted.

The timescales contained in the guidance are a matter for the President of the Family Division. However, it is important to remember that Practice Guidance is just that. For the reasons set out above, the expectation is that the guidance will be strictly complied with to ensure that the child is brought expeditiously within the statutory regulatory regime. However, that does not exclude flexibility in an appropriate case. For example, it is inconceivable that a child would be left without the protection afforded by an authorisation under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court because an application for registration cannot be submitted within 7 days of the first hearing in a case where there are good reasons for this, where the provider and the local authority are working to a defined plan checked by Ofsted, where the provider and the local authority are engaging in a dialogue with Ofsted, are being transparent about each step and any hurdles faced, are meeting the planned objectives, have provided the court with detailed plans and evidence of review, monitoring, support to ensure that the standards inside the placement are high, and where the local authority, providers and Ofsted are  \n\t   ad idem  on the approach being taken. Whilst, for the reasons I have given, the court should not ordinarily countenance the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction in respect of a placement that will not or cannot apply for registration as required by law, it is equally the case that where a provider and a local authority working with Ofsted to achieve that end, the court will not seek to frustrate that approach by the overzealous enforcement of timescales contained in non-statutory Practice Guidance."

Those measures are not identical to  but very similar to those covered by Article 1(2) of Brussels IIA, which also covers guardianship, curatorship and similar institutions, designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's personal property, representing or assistance of the child and the placement of a child in a foster family or in institutional care.

His degree of integration was insufficient to bring about a change.  In particular, his time in Dubai lacked the necessary quality of stability to amount to an habitual residence on 13 November 2023.  For the initial period, I was informed by Mr Alyas that he and his mother were staying in the maternal grandmother's property.  They only moved to their own separate accommodation on 30 September 2023.  K's situation in Dubai was fundamentally unstable.  There were no arrangements in place for him to have contact with his father on a regular basis (or at all).  The mother had taken actions which had the effect of preventing him from returning to his country of birth and nationality. The father was being marginalised and prevented from exercising his parental responsibility. K was the subject of litigation in Dubai and caught in the middle of an increasingly acrimonious dispute.  He was on the point of being the subject of litigation in England.  All of those matters lead me to the conclusion that this was a case in which a transfer of habitual residence from England and Wales to Dubai would, to paraphrase Lord Wilson, be slow to occur.  That transfer had not, in my judgment, been achieved by 13 November 2023. \n\t  "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 35. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The leading case providing guidance on how to deal with applications under Part III is  \n\t   Agbaje v Agbaje  [2010] UKSC 13  where Lord Collins sets out the following, under the heading 'The proper approach': \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     To take up some of the points made in the preceding paragraphs, the proper approach to Part III simply depends on a careful application of sections 16, 17 and 18 in the light of the legislative purpose, which was the alleviation of the adverse consequences of no, or no adequate, financial provision being made by a foreign court in a situation where there were substantial connections with England. There are two, inter-related, duties of the court before making an order under Part III. The first is to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application: section 16(1). The second is to consider whether an order should be made under section 17 having regard to the matters in section 18. There are two reasons why the duties are inter-related. First, neither section 16(2) nor section 18(2) and (3) refers to an exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account. Section 16(1) directs the court to have regard to \"all the circumstances of the case\" and section 16(2) refers the court to certain matters \"in particular.\" Second, some of the matters to be considered under section 16 may be relevant under section 18, and vice versa. An obvious example would be that section 16(2)(e) refers the court to the financial provision which has been made by the foreign court. Plainly that would be relevant under section 18. So also the direction in section 18(6) to the court, in considering the financial resources of a party, \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     to have regard to whether an order of a foreign court has been complied with would plainly be relevant in considering whether England is the appropriate venue. \n\t     \n\t   72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     It is not the purpose of Part III to allow a spouse (usually, in current conditions, the wife) with some English connections to make an application in England to take advantage of what may well be the more generous approach in England to financial provision, particularly in so-called big-money cases. There is no condition of exceptionality for the purposes of section 16, but it will not usually be a case for an order under Part III where the wife had a right to apply for financial relief under the foreign law, and an award was made in the foreign country. In such cases mere disparity between that award and what would be awarded on an English divorce will certainly be insufficient to trigger the application of Part III. Nor is hardship or injustice (much less serious injustice) a condition of the exercise of the jurisdiction, but if either factor is present, it may make it appropriate, in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made, and may affect the nature of the provision ordered. Of course, the court will not lightly characterise foreign law, or the order of a foreign court, as unjust. \n\t     \n\t 73. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The amount of financial provision will depend on all the circumstances of the case and there is no rule that it should be the minimum amount required to overcome injustice. The following general principles should be applied. First, primary consideration must be given to the welfare of any children of the marriage. This can cut both ways as the children may be being supported by the foreign spouse. Second, it will never be appropriate to make an order which gives the claimant more than she or he would have been awarded had all proceedings taken place within this jurisdiction. Third, where possible the order should have the result that provision is made for the reasonable needs of each spouse. Subject to these principles, the court has a broad discretion. The reasons why it was appropriate for an order to be made in England are among the circumstances to be taken into account in deciding what order should be made. Where the English connections of the case are very strong there may be no reason why the application should not be treated as if it were made in purely English proceedings. The full procedure for granting ancillary relief after an English divorce does not apply in Part III cases. The conditions which can be attached to leave, together with the court's case management powers, can be used to define the issues and to limit the evidence to be filed, as was done by Munby J in this case. This enables the jurisdiction to be tailored to the needs of the individual case, so that the grant of leave does not inevitably trigger a full blown claim for all forms of ancillary relief."

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 55. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t Mr Metzer KC invited me to state that there would be a strong presumption against the admission of evidence relating to a complainant's sexual history with an alleged perpetrator and to declare that the circumstances should be exceptional. I decline to do so. First, that approach runs contrary to current practice in the family court which has been centred on relevance and is free from presumption or starting point. It also runs contrary to the basic principle that, by adopting an inquisitorial approach, the court requires the best  \n\t   relevant  evidence before it to assess both the risk posed by a parent or the welfare best interests of the child. Second, and practically speaking, the Appellant's approach runs the risk of depriving the court of evidence relevant to its factual determination. I observe that there may well be circumstances in which evidence of sexual history  as between partners  is relevant to the court's assessment of the dynamic, their respective patterns of behaviour and the nature of their relationship."

    "section_texts" : [ "1 Medical termination of pregnancy. (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a person shall not be guilty of an offence under the law relating to abortion when a pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith' (a) that the pregnancy has not exceeded its twenty-fourth week and that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family; or (b) that the termination is necessary to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; or (c) that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated; or (d) that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. (2) In determining whether the continuance of a pregnancy would involve such risk of injury to health as is mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (1) of this section, account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment. (3) Except as provided by subsections (3B) to (4) of this section, any treatment for the termination of pregnancy must be carried out in a hospital vested in the Secretary of State for the purposes of his functions under the National Health Service Act 2006 or the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 or in a hospital vested in ... a National Health Service trust or an NHS foundation trust or in a place approved for the purposes of this section by the Secretary of State (3A) The power under subsection (3) of this section to approve a place' (a) includes power, in relation to treatment consisting primarily in the use of such medicines as may be specified in the approval and carried out in such manner as may be so specified, to approve a class of places (b) is not limited by subsections (3C) and (3D) . (3B) Subsections (3C) and (3D) apply where' (a) the treatment referred to in subsection (3) consists of the prescription and administration of medicine, and (b) the registered medical practitioner terminating the pregnancy is of the opinion, formed in good faith, that, if the medicine is administered in accordance with their instructions, the pregnancy will not exceed ten weeks at the time when the medicine is administered (or in the case of a course of medicine, when the first medicine in the course is administered). (3C) If the usual place of residence of the registered medical practitioner terminating the pregnancy is in England or Wales, the medicine may be prescribed from that place by the registered medical practitioner. (3D) If the pregnant woman's usual place of residence is in England or Wales and she has had a consultation (in person, by telephone or by electronic means) with a registered medical practitioner, registered nurse or registered midwife about the termination of the pregnancy, the medicine may be self-administered by the pregnant woman at that place. (4) Subsection (3) of this section, and so much of subsection (1) as relates to the opinion of two registered medical practitioners, shall not apply to the termination of a pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner in a case where he is of the opinion, formed in good faith, that the termination is immediately necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman." ] ,

(2) In that ScheduleÄî (a) Part 1 makes provision about powers of courts in England and Wales to make female genital mutilation protection orders; (b) Part 2 makes provision about powers of courts in Northern Ireland to make such orders. (2) After Schedule 1 to that Act (inserted by section 71(2) above) insertÄî SCHEDULE 2 Female genital mutilation protection orders PART 1 England and Wales Power to make FGM protection order 1 (1) The court in England and Wales may make an order (an ÄúFGM protection orderÄù) for the purposes ofÄî (a) protecting a girl against the commission of a genital mutilation offence, or (b) protecting a girl against whom any such offence has been committed.

(8) Regulations under sub-paragraph (7) are to be made by statutory instrument, and any such instrument is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. Power to make order in criminal proceedings 3 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in England and Wales for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 4 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence. (2) In the case of an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 5(1), a person can be guilty of an offence under this paragraph only in respect of conduct engaged in at a time when the person was aware of the existence of the order. (3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct, the conduct is not punishable as a contempt of court. (4) A person cannot be convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct which has been punished as a contempt of court.

(7) Äú Enactment Äù includes an enactment contained in subordinate legislation within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978. Ex parte orders 5 (1) The court may, in any case where it is just and convenient to do so, make an FGM protection order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under sub-paragraph (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the risk to the girl, or to another person, of becoming a victim of a genital mutilation offence if the order is not made immediately, (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately, and (c) whether there is reason to believe thatÄî (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service, and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the girl to be protected or (if different) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about an order made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1). (4) The opportunity must beÄî (a) as soon as just and convenient, and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. Variation and discharge of orders 6 (1) The court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order on an application byÄî (a) any party to the proceedings for the order, (b) the girl being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order), or (c) any person affected by the order. (2) In the case of an order made in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(a) to a party to the proceedings for the order is to be read as a reference to the prosecution and the defendant.

(4) Paragraph 5 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Arrest under warrant 7 (1) An interested party may apply to the relevant judge for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person if the interested party considers that the person has failed to comply with an FGM protection order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to such an order. (2) The relevant judge must not issue a warrant on an application under sub-paragraph (1) unlessÄî (a) the application is substantiated on oath, and (b) the relevant judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) In this paragraph Äú interested party Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) the girl being protected by the order, (b) (if a different person) the person who applied for the order, or (c) any other person; but no application may be made under sub-paragraph (1) by a person falling within paragraph (c) without leave of the relevant judge. Remand: general 8 (1) The court before which an arrested person is brought by virtue of a warrant under paragraph 7 may, if the matter is not then disposed of immediately, remand the person concerned. (2) Paragraphs 9 to 14 contain further provision about the powers of a court to remand under this paragraph. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies if a person remanded under this paragraph is granted bail under paragraphs 10 to 14.

Remand: medical examination and report 9 (1) Any power to remand a person under paragraph 8(1) may be exercised for the purpose of enabling a medical examination and report to be made if the relevant judge has reason to consider that a medical report will be required. (2) If such a power is so exercised, the adjournment must not be for more than four weeks at a time unless the relevant judge remands the accused in custody. (3) If the relevant judge remands the accused in custody, the adjournment must not be for more than three weeks at a time. (4) Sub-paragraph (5) applies if there is reason to suspect that a person who has been arrested under a warrant issued on an application under paragraph 7(1) is suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. (5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Remand: further provision 10 (1) Where a court has power to remand a person under paragraph 8, the court may remand the person in custody or on bail. (2) If remanded in custody, the person is to be committed to custody to be brought before the courtÄî (a) at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at such earlier time as the court may require. (3) The court may remand a person on bailÄî (a) by taking from the person a recognizance (with or without sureties) conditioned as provided in paragraph 11, or (b) by fixing the amount of the recognizances with a view to their being taken subsequently in accordance with paragraph 14 and, in the meantime, committing the person to custody as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above. (4) Where a person is brought before the court after remand the court may further remand the person. (5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent. (2) If sub-paragraph (1)(a) applies, the person may be remanded for the period of the adjournment. (3) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody, the person may be committed to the custody of a constable if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days. 13 (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear before the court at the end of the period of remand, the court may further remand the person in his or her absence. (2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge. Other protection or assistance against female genital mutilation 16 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects any other protection or assistance available to a girl who is or may become the victim of a genital mutilation offence. (2) In particular, it does not affectÄî (a) the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court; (b) any criminal liability; (c) any civil remedies under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; (d) any right to an occupation order or a non-molestation order under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996; (e) any right to a forced marriage protection order under Part 4A of that Act; (f) any protection or assistance under the Children Act 1989; (g) any claim in tort. Interpretation 17 (1) In this Part of this ScheduleÄî Äúthe courtÄù, except as provided in sub-paragraph (2), means the High Court, or the family court, in England and Wales; Äú FGM protection order Äù means an order under paragraph 1; Äú genital mutilation offence Äù means an offence under section 1, 2 or 3; Äú the relevant judge Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) where the order was made by the High Court, a judge of that court; (b) where the order was made by the family court, a judge of that court; (c) where the order was made by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3Äî (i) a judge of that court, or (ii) a judge of the High Court or of the family court. (2) Where the power to make an FGM protection order is exercisable by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, references in this Part of this Schedule to Äúthe courtÄù (other than in paragraph 2) are to be read as references to that court. (3) In paragraph (c)(i) of the definition of Äúrelevant judgeÄù in sub-paragraph (1), the reference to a judge of the court that made the order includes, in the case of criminal proceedings in a magistrates' court, a reference to a justice of the peace.

(3) If the court makes an order by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), it must specify a date for a full hearing. (4) In sub-paragraph (3), Äú full hearing Äù means a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court.

(2) In the case of an order made in criminal proceedings under paragraph 20, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(a) to a party to the proceedings for the order is to be read as a reference to the prosecution and the defendant. (3) In addition, the court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 19(1)(b) or 20 even though no application under sub-paragraph (1) above has been made to the court. (4) Paragraph 22 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Jurisdiction of courts 24 (1) For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, Äú the court Äù means the High Court, or a county court, in Northern Ireland. (2) Sub-paragraph (1) is subject toÄî (a) sub-paragraph (3), and (b) any provision made by virtue of sub-paragraph (4) or (5).

(7) Any order of the High Court made on an appeal under sub-paragraph (1) (other than one directing that an application be re-heard by the county court) is to be treated, for the purposes ofÄî (a) the enforcement of the order, and (b) any power to vary, revive or discharge orders, as if it were an order of the county court from which the appeal was brought and not an order of the High Court. (8) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 28. Appeals: transfers and proposed transfers 28 (1) The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may, after consulting the Lord Chief Justice, by order make provision as to the circumstances in which appeals may be made against decisions taken by courts on questions arising in connection with the transfer, or proposed transfer, of proceedings by virtue of an order made under Article 34(5) of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ( S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)) as applied by paragraph 24(4) and (5) above.

(3) A person (ÄúPÄù) falls within this subsection ifÄî (a) P is a parent of C; (b) P is not a parent of C but has parental responsibility for C; or (c) in a case where C is in the care of the local authority and there was a child arrangements order in force with respect to C immediately before the care order was made, P was a person named in the child arrangements order as a person with whom C was to live . (4) Subsection (2) does not require the local authority to make arrangements of the kind mentioned in that subsection if doing soÄî (a) would not be consistent with C's welfare; or (b) would not be reasonably practicable. (5) If the local authority are unable to make arrangements under subsection (2), they must place C in the placement which is, in their opinion, the most appropriate placement available. (6) In subsection (5) Äú placement Äù meansÄî (a) placement with an individual who is a relative, friend or other person connected with C and who is also a local authority foster parent; (b) placement with a local authority foster parent who does not fall within paragraph (a); (c) placement in a children's home in respect of which a person is registered under Part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000 or Part 1 of the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 2) ; or (d) subject to section 22D, placement in accordance with other arrangements which comply with any regulations made for the purposes of this section. (7) In determining the most appropriate placement for C, the local authority must, subject to subsection (9B) and the other provisions of this Part (in particular, to their duties under section 22)Äî (a) give preference to a placement falling within paragraph (a) of subsection (6) over placements falling within the other paragraphs of that subsection; (b) comply, so far as is reasonably practicable in all the circumstances of C's case, with the requirements of subsection (8); and (c) comply with subsection (9) unless that is not reasonably practicable. (8) The local authority must ensure that the placement is such thatÄî (a) it allows C to live near C's home; (b) it does not disrupt C's education or training; (c) if C has a sibling for whom the local authority are also providing accommodation, it enables C and the sibling to live together; (d) if C is disabled, the accommodation provided is suitable to C's particular needs. (9) The placement must be such that C is provided with accommodation within the local authority's area. (9A) Subsection (9B) applies (subject to subsection (9C)) where the local authority ...Äî (a) are considering adoption for C, or (b) are satisfied that C ought to be placed for adoption but are not authorised under section 19 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (placement with parental consent) or by virtue of section 21 of that Act (placement orders) to place C for adoption. (9B) Where this subsection appliesÄî (a) subsections (7) to (9) do not apply to the local authority, (b) the local authority must consider placing C with an individual within subsection (6)(a), and (c) where the local authority decide that a placement with such an individual is not the most appropriate placement for C, the local authority must consider placing C with a local authority foster parent who has been approved as a prospective adopter. (9C) Subsection (9B) does not apply where the local authority have applied for a placement order under section 21 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in respect of C and the application has been refused.

Further, a childÄôs best interests falls to be evaluated taking into account all relevant circumstances. Whilst the absence of a placement may place the child at risk, the court must also take account of the fact that it is likely to be antithetic to a childÄôs best interests to be deprived of the protections of the statutory regulatory regime mandated by Parliament. Within this context, in the experience of this court, the providers that are unwilling to apply for registration of those offering placements that are the most problematic for vulnerable children in respect of which the court most regularly encounters a refusal to apply for registration, examples including holiday parks, private Air B&B properties, caravans and canal boats. These expose the child to a double deficit in the form of a sub-optimal placement that is also outwith the statutory regulatory regime designed to safeguard him or her. In such circumstances, for the court to acquiesce in the face of a refusal of a provider even to seek registration is to heighten significantly the risk to the highly vulnerable subject child. "

(6) The services provided by a local authority in the exercise of functions conferred on them by this section may include providing accommodation and giving assistance in kind or . . . in cash. (7) Assistance may be unconditional or subject to conditions as to the repayment of the assistance or of its value (in whole or in part). (8) Before giving any assistance or imposing any conditions, a local authority shall have regard to the means of the child concerned and of each of his parents. (9) No person shall be liable to make any repayment of assistance or of its value at any time when he is in receipt of universal credit (except in such circumstances as may be prescribed), of income support under Part VII of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, of any element of child tax credit other than the family element, of working tax credit , of an income-based jobseeker's allowance or of an income-related employment and support allowance .

(11) For the purposes of this Part, a child is disabled if he is blind, deaf or dumb or suffers from mental disorder of any kind or is substantially and permanently handicapped by illness, injury or congenital deformity or such other disability as may be prescribed; and in this Part' ' development ' means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development; and ' health ' means physical or mental health. (12) The Treasury may by regulations prescribe circumstances in which a person is to be treated for the purposes of this Part (or for such of those purposes as are prescribed) as in receipt of any element of child tax credit other than the family element or of working tax credit. (13) The duties imposed on a local authority by virtue of this section do not apply in relation to a child in the authority's area who is being looked after by a local authority in Wales in accordance with Part 6 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014." ] ,

(5) If the local authority are unable to make arrangements under subsection (2), they must place C in the placement which is, in their opinion, the most appropriate placement available. (6) In subsection (5) Äú placement Äù meansÄî (a) placement with an individual who is a relative, friend or other person connected with C and who is also a local authority foster parent; (b) placement with a local authority foster parent who does not fall within paragraph (a); (c) placement in a children's home in respect of which a person is registered under Part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000 or Part 1 of the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 2) ; or (d) subject to section 22D, placement in accordance with other arrangements which comply with any regulations made for the purposes of this section. (7) In determining the most appropriate placement for C, the local authority must, subject to subsection (9B) and the other provisions of this Part (in particular, to their duties under section 22)Äî (a) give preference to a placement falling within paragraph (a) of subsection (6) over placements falling within the other paragraphs of that subsection; (b) comply, so far as is reasonably practicable in all the circumstances of C's case, with the requirements of subsection (8); and (c) comply with subsection (9) unless that is not reasonably practicable.

(7) Subsection (6) does not require the agreement of a person who cannot be found or is incapable of giving agreement; and the agreement of the woman who carried the child is ineffective for the purpose of that subsection if given by her less than six weeks after the child's birth. (8) The court must be satisfied that no money or other benefit (other than for expenses reasonably incurred) has been given or received by either of the applicants for or in consideration of' (a) the making of the order, (b) any agreement required by subsection (6), (c) the handing over of the child to the applicants, or (d) the making of arrangements with a view to the making of the order, unless authorised by the court.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 39 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The next decision is one of Sir James Munby (President of the Family Division as he then was) in  \n\t   Re X (Surrogacy: Time Limit)   [2014] EWHC 3135 (Fam) .  As the case title suggests, the difficulty in that case was that the application for a parental order was made well outside the six month time limit for bringing such an application to the court.  The question for the President was whether the provisions could be read in such a way as to allow an application to proceed out of time.  Sir James Munby took the opportunity to refer to the judgment of Theis J in  A v P  and to add his own further observations in these terms:  \n\t     \n\t   \"58. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If for some reason that is wrong, if that is wrong, if to go that far is in truth to take a step too far, the same conclusion is, in my judgment, amply justified having regard to the Convention. The two key authorities here are the decision of Theis J in  \n\t     A v P  ... and the later decision of the Supreme Court inï¿½ï¿½ Pomiechowski v District Court of Legnica, Poland and another .  Although, as I have pointed out, Theis J founded her analysis on Article 8, whilst the Supreme Court's analysis was based on Article 6, the reasoning in both cases is fundamentally the same: the statute must be 'read down' in such a way as to ensure that the 'essence' of the protected right is not impaired and that what is being protected are rights that are 'practical and effective' and not 'theoretical and illusory'. \n\t     \n\t   \"59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I agree entirely with Theis J's powerful and compelling reasoning. Her focus was on  \n\t     section 54(4) (a) [ HFEA 2008 ], but in my judgment her reasoning applies  mutatis mutandis  with equal force to  section 54(3) . \n\t     \n\t   \"60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I add two things. First, I draw attention to the fact that Theis J was prepared to read down ' and in my judgment correctly prepared to read down '  \n\t     section 54(4) (a) to enable her to make a parental order after one of the commissioning parents had died notwithstanding that  section 54(4) (a), in contrast it may be noted to  section 54(3) , seemingly requires the relevant condition to be satisfied both 'at the time of the application' and 'at the time of ï¿½Ä¶ the making of the order.' If that degree of 'reading down' is permissible in relation to  section 54(4) (a) ' and Theis J held that it was, and I respectfully agree ' then the lesser degree of 'reading down' required in relation to  section 54(3)  is surely  a fortiori . \n\t     \n\t \"61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The other point is this. Theis J focussed on that aspect of Article 8 [of the European Convention] which protects 'family life', but Article 8 also protects 'private life', and 'identity', on which she appropriately laid stress, is an important aspect of 'private life'. So, any application for a parental order implicates both the child's right to 'family life' and also the child's right to 'private life'. The distinction does not matter in the circumstances of the present case (...) but I make the point because it is, I suppose, possible to conceive of a case where, on the facts, it might be more difficult or even impossible to demonstrate the existence of 'family life'.\" \n\t    "

(3) Relevant treatment is section 58 type treatment or section 58A type treatment if, at the time when it is given to the patient, section 58 or 58A above (respectively) would have applied to it, had the patient remained liable to be detained at that time (rather than being a community patient). (4) The certificate requirement is met in respect of treatment to be given to a patient ifÄî (a) a registered medical practitioner appointed for the purposes of Part 4 of this Act (not being the responsible clinician or the person in charge of the treatment) has certified in writing that it is appropriate for the treatment to be given or for the treatment to be given subject to such conditions as may be specified in the certificate; and (b) if conditions are so specified, the conditions are satisfied. (4A) Where there is authority to give treatment by virtue of subsection (2)(a), the certificate requirement is also met in respect of the treatment if the approved clinician in charge of the treatment has certified in writing that the patient has capacity to consent to the treatment and has consented to it. (4B) But, if the patient has not attained the age of 18, subsection (4A) does not apply to section 58A type treatment. (5) In a case where the treatment is section 58 type treatment, treatment is immediately necessary ifÄî (a) it is immediately necessary to save the patient's life; or (b) it is immediately necessary to prevent a serious deterioration of the patient's condition and is not irreversible; or (c) it is immediately necessary to alleviate serious suffering by the patient and is not irreversible or hazardous; or (d) it is immediately necessary, represents the minimum interference necessary to prevent the patient from behaving violently or being a danger to himself or others and is not irreversible or hazardous. (6) In a case where the treatment is section 58A type treatment by virtue of subsection (1)(a) of that section, treatment is immediately necessary if it falls within paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (5) above. (7) In a case where the treatment is section 58A type treatment by virtue of subsection (1)(b) of that section, treatment is immediately necessary if it falls within such of paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (5) above as may be specified in regulations under that section. (8) For the purposes of subsection (7) above, the regulationsÄî (a) may make different provision for different cases (and may, in particular, make different provision for different forms of treatment); (b) may make provision which applies subject to specified exceptions; and (c) may include transitional, consequential, incidental or supplemental provision.

These cases include  A NHS Trust v A [2013] EWHC 2442 (COP)  where Baker J was considering the force feeding of an asylum seeker who was detained under  section 3   MHA 1983 . In that case, the Official Solicitor had submitted at [73] that  Croydon, Brady, and Tameside  (previous cases on the use of  section 63 )  Äòtaken together are authority for the proposition that the necessary feeding and associated measures in this case can be taken under the MHAÄô . The associated measures must have included sedation as needed. Mr Lock argued that the issue of section 58 was not addressed in those cases, and that it is not clear the degree to which the treatment in question would have required medication. It may be that in some of these cases the question of the use of section 58 rather than  section 63  was not raised, but it is apparent from the passage of Neil LJ in "

    "section_texts" : [ "73 Female genital mutilation protection orders (1) After section 5 of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 insertÄî 5A Female genital mutilation protection orders (1) Schedule 2 provides for the making of female genital mutilation protection orders. (2) In that ScheduleÄî (a) Part 1 makes provision about powers of courts in England and Wales to make female genital mutilation protection orders; (b) Part 2 makes provision about powers of courts in Northern Ireland to make such orders. (2) After Schedule 1 to that Act (inserted by section 71(2) above) insertÄî SCHEDULE 2 Female genital mutilation protection orders PART 1 England and Wales Power to make FGM protection order 1 (1) The court in England and Wales may make an order (an ÄúFGM protection orderÄù) for the purposes ofÄî (a) protecting a girl against the commission of a genital mutilation offence, or (b) protecting a girl against whom any such offence has been committed. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under this paragraph and, if so, in what manner, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the girl to be protected. (3) An FGM protection order may containÄî (a) such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements, and (b) such other terms, as the court considers appropriate for the purposes of the order. (4) The terms of an FGM protection order may, in particular, relate toÄî (a) conduct outside England and Wales as well as (or instead of) conduct within England and Wales; (b) respondents who are, or may become, involved in other respects as well as (or instead of) respondents who commit or attempt to commit, or may commit or attempt to commit, a genital mutilation offence against a girl; (c) other persons who are, or may become, involved in other respects as well as respondents of any kind. (5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) examples of involvement in other respects areÄî (a) aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, encouraging or assisting another person to commit, or attempt to commit, a genital mutilation offence against a girl; (b) conspiring to commit, or to attempt to commit, such an offence. (6) An FGM protection order may be made for a specified period or until varied or discharged (see paragraph 6). Applications and other occasions for making orders 2 (1) The court may make an FGM protection orderÄî (a) on an application being made to it, or (b) without an application being made to it but in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (6). (2) An application may be made byÄî (a) the girl who is to be protected by the order, or (b) a relevant third party. (3) An application may be made by any other person with the leave of the court. (4) In deciding whether to grant leave, the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the applicant's connection with the girl to be protected; (b) the applicant's knowledge of the circumstances of the girl. (5) An application under this paragraph may be made in other family proceedings or without any other family proceedings being instituted. (6) The circumstances in which the court may make an order without an application being made are whereÄî (a) any other family proceedings are before the court (Äúthe current proceedingsÄù), (b) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not a party to the proceedings), and (c) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a party to the current proceedings. (7) In this paragraphÄî Äú family proceedings Äù has the same meaning as in Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996 (see section 63(1) and (2) of that Act), but also includesÄî (a) proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to adults, (b) proceedings in which the court has made an emergency protection order under section 44 of the Children Act 1989 which includes an exclusion requirement (as defined in section 44A(3) of that Act), and (c) proceedings in which the court has made an order under section 50 of the Children Act 1989 (recovery of abducted children etc ); Äú relevant third party Äù means a person specified, or falling within a description of persons specified, by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor (and such regulations may, in particular, specify the Secretary of State). (8) Regulations under sub-paragraph (7) are to be made by statutory instrument, and any such instrument is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. Power to make order in criminal proceedings 3 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in England and Wales for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 4 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence. (2) In the case of an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 5(1), a person can be guilty of an offence under this paragraph only in respect of conduct engaged in at a time when the person was aware of the existence of the order. (3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct, the conduct is not punishable as a contempt of court. (4) A person cannot be convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct which has been punished as a contempt of court. (5) A person guilty of an offence under this paragraph is liableÄî (a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a fine, or both; (b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or a fine, or both. (6) A reference in any enactment to proceedings under this Part of this Schedule, or to an order under this Part of this Schedule, does not include a reference to proceedings for an offence under this paragraph or to an order made in proceedings for such an offence. (7) Äú Enactment Äù includes an enactment contained in subordinate legislation within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978. Ex parte orders 5 (1) The court may, in any case where it is just and convenient to do so, make an FGM protection order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under sub-paragraph (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the risk to the girl, or to another person, of becoming a victim of a genital mutilation offence if the order is not made immediately, (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately, and (c) whether there is reason to believe thatÄî (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service, and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the girl to be protected or (if different) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about an order made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1). (4) The opportunity must beÄî (a) as soon as just and convenient, and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. Variation and discharge of orders 6 (1) The court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order on an application byÄî (a) any party to the proceedings for the order, (b) the girl being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order), or (c) any person affected by the order. (2) In the case of an order made in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(a) to a party to the proceedings for the order is to be read as a reference to the prosecution and the defendant. (3) In addition, the court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 2(1)(b) or 3 even though no application under sub-paragraph (1) above has been made to the court. (4) Paragraph 5 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Arrest under warrant 7 (1) An interested party may apply to the relevant judge for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person if the interested party considers that the person has failed to comply with an FGM protection order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to such an order. (2) The relevant judge must not issue a warrant on an application under sub-paragraph (1) unlessÄî (a) the application is substantiated on oath, and (b) the relevant judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) In this paragraph Äú interested party Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) the girl being protected by the order, (b) (if a different person) the person who applied for the order, or (c) any other person; but no application may be made under sub-paragraph (1) by a person falling within paragraph (c) without leave of the relevant judge. Remand: general 8 (1) The court before which an arrested person is brought by virtue of a warrant under paragraph 7 may, if the matter is not then disposed of immediately, remand the person concerned. (2) Paragraphs 9 to 14 contain further provision about the powers of a court to remand under this paragraph. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies if a person remanded under this paragraph is granted bail under paragraphs 10 to 14. (4) The person may be required by the relevant judge to comply, before release on bail or later, with such requirements as appear to the judge to be necessary to secure that the person does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Remand: medical examination and report 9 (1) Any power to remand a person under paragraph 8(1) may be exercised for the purpose of enabling a medical examination and report to be made if the relevant judge has reason to consider that a medical report will be required. (2) If such a power is so exercised, the adjournment must not be for more than four weeks at a time unless the relevant judge remands the accused in custody. (3) If the relevant judge remands the accused in custody, the adjournment must not be for more than three weeks at a time. (4) Sub-paragraph (5) applies if there is reason to suspect that a person who has been arrested under a warrant issued on an application under paragraph 7(1) is suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. (5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Remand: further provision 10 (1) Where a court has power to remand a person under paragraph 8, the court may remand the person in custody or on bail. (2) If remanded in custody, the person is to be committed to custody to be brought before the courtÄî (a) at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at such earlier time as the court may require. (3) The court may remand a person on bailÄî (a) by taking from the person a recognizance (with or without sureties) conditioned as provided in paragraph 11, or (b) by fixing the amount of the recognizances with a view to their being taken subsequently in accordance with paragraph 14 and, in the meantime, committing the person to custody as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above. (4) Where a person is brought before the court after remand the court may further remand the person. (5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent. (2) If sub-paragraph (1)(a) applies, the person may be remanded for the period of the adjournment. (3) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody, the person may be committed to the custody of a constable if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days. 13 (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear before the court at the end of the period of remand, the court may further remand the person in his or her absence. (2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge. Other protection or assistance against female genital mutilation 16 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects any other protection or assistance available to a girl who is or may become the victim of a genital mutilation offence. (2) In particular, it does not affectÄî (a) the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court; (b) any criminal liability; (c) any civil remedies under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; (d) any right to an occupation order or a non-molestation order under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996; (e) any right to a forced marriage protection order under Part 4A of that Act; (f) any protection or assistance under the Children Act 1989; (g) any claim in tort. Interpretation 17 (1) In this Part of this ScheduleÄî Äúthe courtÄù, except as provided in sub-paragraph (2), means the High Court, or the family court, in England and Wales; Äú FGM protection order Äù means an order under paragraph 1; Äú genital mutilation offence Äù means an offence under section 1, 2 or 3; Äú the relevant judge Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) where the order was made by the High Court, a judge of that court; (b) where the order was made by the family court, a judge of that court; (c) where the order was made by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3Äî (i) a judge of that court, or (ii) a judge of the High Court or of the family court. (2) Where the power to make an FGM protection order is exercisable by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, references in this Part of this Schedule to Äúthe courtÄù (other than in paragraph 2) are to be read as references to that court. (3) In paragraph (c)(i) of the definition of Äúrelevant judgeÄù in sub-paragraph (1), the reference to a judge of the court that made the order includes, in the case of criminal proceedings in a magistrates' court, a reference to a justice of the peace. PART 2 Northern Ireland Power to make FGM protection order 18 (1) The court in Northern Ireland may make an order (an ÄúFGM protection orderÄù) for the purposes ofÄî (a) protecting a girl against the commission of a genital mutilation offence, or (b) protecting a girl against whom any such offence has been committed. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under this paragraph and, if so, in what manner, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the girl to be protected.

Power to make order in criminal proceedings 20 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in Northern Ireland for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 21 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence.

(3) If the court makes an order by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), it must specify a date for a full hearing. (4) In sub-paragraph (3), Äú full hearing Äù means a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. Variation and discharge of orders 23 (1) The court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order on an application byÄî (a) any party to the proceedings for the order, (b) the girl being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order), or (c) any person affected by the order. (2) In the case of an order made in criminal proceedings under paragraph 20, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(a) to a party to the proceedings for the order is to be read as a reference to the prosecution and the defendant. (3) In addition, the court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 19(1)(b) or 20 even though no application under sub-paragraph (1) above has been made to the court. (4) Paragraph 22 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Jurisdiction of courts 24 (1) For the purposes of this Part of this Schedule, Äú the court Äù means the High Court, or a county court, in Northern Ireland.

(4) Article 34(3) to (10) of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ( S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)) (allocation of proceedings to courts etc ) applies for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule as it applies for the purposes of that Order but as if the following modification were made. (5) The modification is that Article 34(8) is to be read as if there were substituted for itÄî (8) For the purposes of paragraphs (3), (4) and (5), there are two levels of courtÄî (a) the High Court; and (b) a county court. Power to extend jurisdiction to courts of summary jurisdiction 25 (1) The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may, after consulting the Lord Chief Justice, by order provide for courts of summary jurisdiction to be included among the courts who may hear proceedings under this Part of this Schedule.

(3) Any power to make an order under this paragraph (including the power as extended by paragraph 29(1)) may, in particular, be exercised by amending, repealing, revoking or otherwise modifying any provision made by or under this Part of this Schedule or any other enactment. (4) In sub-paragraph (3) Äú enactment Äù includes Northern Ireland legislation.

Contempt proceedings 26 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge. Appeals from county courts 27 (1) An appeal lies to the High Court againstÄî (a) the making by a county court of any order under this Part of this Schedule, or (b) any refusal by a county court to make such an order, as if the decision had been made in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by Part 3 of the County Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 ( S.I. 1980/397 (N.I. 3)) (original civil jurisdiction) and the appeal were brought under Article 60 of that Order (ordinary appeals in civil cases). (2) But an appeal does not lie to the High Court under sub-paragraph (1) where the county court is a divorce county court exercising jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 ( S.I. 1978/1045 (N.I. 15)) in the same proceedings. (3) Provision must be made by rules of court for an appeal to lie (upon a point of law, a question of fact or the admission or rejection of any evidence) to the Court of Appeal againstÄî (a) the making of any order under this Part of this Schedule, or (b) any refusal to make such an order, by a county court of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (2). (4) Sub-paragraph (3) is without prejudice to Article 61 of the County Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1980 ( S.I. 1980/397 (N.I. 3)) (cases stated). (5) On an appeal under sub-paragraph (1), the High Court may make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to its determination of the appeal. (6) Where an order is made under sub-paragraph (5), the High Court may also make such incidental or consequential orders as appear to it to be just. (7) Any order of the High Court made on an appeal under sub-paragraph (1) (other than one directing that an application be re-heard by the county court) is to be treated, for the purposes ofÄî (a) the enforcement of the order, and (b) any power to vary, revive or discharge orders, as if it were an order of the county court from which the appeal was brought and not an order of the High Court. (8) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 28. Appeals: transfers and proposed transfers 28 (1) The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland may, after consulting the Lord Chief Justice, by order make provision as to the circumstances in which appeals may be made against decisions taken by courts on questions arising in connection with the transfer, or proposed transfer, of proceedings by virtue of an order made under Article 34(5) of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ( S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)) as applied by paragraph 24(4) and (5) above.

    "section_texts" : [ "27 Financial provision orders, etc. , in case of neglect by party to marriage to maintain other party or child of the family. (1) Either party to a marriage may apply to the court for an order under this section on the ground that the other party to the marriage (in this section referred to as the respondent)' (a) has failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant, or (b) has failed to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for any child of the family. (2) The court may not entertain an application under this section unless' (a) the applicant or the respondent is domiciled in England and Wales on the date of the application; (b) the applicant has been habitually resident there throughout the period of one year ending with that date; or (c) the respondent is resident there on that date. (2A) If the application or part of it relates to a matter in relation to which Article 18 of the 2007 Hague Convention applies, the court may not entertain that application or part of it except where permitted by Article 18. (2B) In subsection (2A), 'the 2007 Hague Convention' means the Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance concluded on 23 November 2007 at The Hague. (3) Where an application under this section is made on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(a) above, then, in deciding' (a) whether the respondent has failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant, and (b) what order, if any, to make under this section in favour of the applicant, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters mentioned in section 25(2) above, and where an application is also made under this section in respect of a child of the family who has not attained the age of eighteen, first consideration shall be given to the welfare of the child while a minor. (3A) Where an application under this section is made on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above then, in deciding' (a) whether the respondent has failed to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for the child of the family to whom the application relates, and (b) what order, if any, to make under this section in favour of the child, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters mentioned in section 25(3)(a) to (e) above, and where the child of the family to whom the application relates is not the child of the respondent, including also the matters mentioned in section 25(4) above. (3B) In relation to an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(a) above, section 25(2)(c) above shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the breakdown of the marriage there were substituted a reference to the failure to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant, and in relation to an application under this section on the ground mentioned in subsection (1)(b) above, section 25(2)(c) above (as it applies by virtue of section 25(3)(e) above) shall have effect as if for the reference therein to the breakdown of the marriage there were substituted a reference to the failure to provide, or to make a proper contribution towards, reasonable maintenance for the child of the family to whom the application relates. (5) Where on an application under this section it appears to the court that the applicant or any child of the family to whom the application relates is in immediate need of financial assistance, but it is not yet possible to determine what order, if any, should be made on the application, the court may make an interim order for maintenance, that is to say, an order requiring the respondent to make to the applicant until the determination of the application such periodical payments as the court thinks reasonable. (6) Where on an application under this section the applicant satisfies the court of any ground mentioned in subsection (1) above, the court may make any one or more of the following orders , that is to say' (a) an order that the respondent shall make to the applicant such periodical payments, for such term, as may be specified in the order; (b) an order that the respondent shall secure to the applicant, to the satisfaction of the court, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (c) an order that the respondent shall pay to the applicant such lump sum as may be so specified; (d) an order that the respondent shall make to such person as may be specified in the order for the benefit of the child to whom the application relates, or to that child, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (e) an order that the respondent shall secure to such person as may be so specified for the benefit of that child, or to that child, to the satisfaction of the court, such periodical payments, for such term, as may be so specified; (f) an order that the respondent shall pay to such person as may be so specified for the benefit of that child, or to that child, such lump sum as may be so specified; subject, however, in the case of an order under paragraph (d), (e) or (f) above, to the restrictions imposed by section 29(1) and (3) below on the making of financial provision orders in favour of children who have attained the age of eighteen. (6A) An application for the variation under section 31 of this Act of a periodical payments order or secured periodical payments order made under this section in favour of a child may, if the child has attained the age of sixteen, be made by the child himself. (6B) Where a periodical payments order made in favour of a child under this section ceases to have effect on the date on which the child attains the age of sixteen or at any time after that date but before or on the date on which he attains the age of eighteen, then if, on an application made to the court for an order under this subsection, it appears to the court that' (a) the child is, will be or (if an order were made under this subsection) would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade, profession or vocation, whether or not he also is, will be or would be in gainful employment; or (b) there are special circumstances which justify the making of an order under this subsection, the court shall have power by order to revive the first mentioned order from such date as the court may specify, not being earlier than the date of the making of the application, and to exercise its power under section 31 of this Act in relation to any order so revived. (7) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (6)(c) or (f) above, an order under this section for the payment of a lump sum' (a) may be made for the purpose of enabling any liabilities or expenses reasonably incurred in maintaining the applicant or any child of the family to whom the application relates before the making of the application to be met; (b) may provide for the payment of that sum by instalments of such amount as may be specified in the order and may require the payment of the instalments to be secured to the satisfaction of the court.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   The order I intend to make \n\t     \n\t   73. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Contrary to the submissions of Mr Marks on the Husband's behalf, I am clear that I should make an order.  I would have done so absent the Agreement.  As a result of the repudiation, it is likely that the Agreement is no longer enforceable in Germany.  Despite what I would characterise as the Wife's foolishness in repudiating it, I do not consider she should be in any worse position than if she had never been to either Zurich or Dusseldorf.  An agreement was reached and it should now be encapsulated in an order.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   74. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I have had to consider carefully how to do so to be entirely fair to both parties.  The lump sum is easy.  I order that the Husband pay the Wife ï¿½Ç¨1.5 million on 1 August 2022 and ï¿½Ç¨1.5 million on 1 August 2023.  The maintenance is also relatively straightforward.  I order that he pay her ï¿½Ç¨40,000 per month by way of secured provision from 1 August 2022 payable monthly in advance during her life-time or until further order.  I accept that there must be a remarriage clause.  The Husband is not domiciled in this jurisdiction.  Although the secured provision, in theory, means that the order survives his death, I entirely understand the Wife's concern as to this aspect.  It is clear to me that the Dusseldorf Agreement envisaged her being secure in the knowledge that she would receive this money even if the Husband were to die.  I require the Husband to make arrangements to ensure that the Wife will receive the money even after his death, if she survives him. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   75. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I very much hope that there will not be any difficulty in my order being complied with.  I do take the view that Valentin is likely to assist in ensuring that this is the case.  I do, however, have to guard against the possibility that it will not be.  I take the view that I can capitalise my order at any future stage if that becomes appropriate.  If the Husband were to fail to commence payment of the amount he agreed, I would be minded to capitalise the entire payment in the autumn of this year on application by the Wife.  If he were not able to put in place satisfactory proposals to ensure the Wife received her entitlement after his death, I would again be minded to capitalise the provision but I consider he should have a year from now to make those arrangements. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   76. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to the trickiest part, namely Kinnerton Street.  Again, I intend to abide by the Dusseldorf Agreement.  My order will be that the property is settled upon the Wife pursuant to  \n\t     section 24 (b) of  the 1973 Act  to ensure that she has the exclusive right of occupation of the property for the remainder of her life.  There will then be two deferred contingent lump sums.  The first will be in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 payable on 1 August 2024, index linked in accordance with the CPI, if the Husband, or Valentin, has not acquired the freehold or extended the lease on Kinnerton Street to one of at least fifty years by that date.  This corresponds with the Agreement, which makes provision for an alternative property if it is not possible to purchase the freehold or extend the leasehold.  I cannot see how it would not be possible to extend the lease as I believe that is a legal entitlement.  Nevertheless, if it has not been done, the lump sum becomes payable.  The Wife would then have to give up her right of occupation in Kinnerton Street on payment in full of the contingent lump sum.  The second deferred lump sum will be for the refurbishment works.  Again, the Husband will pay the Wife the sum of ï¿½ï¿½900,000 on 1 August 2024 if he or Valentin has not, by that date, expended at least ï¿½ï¿½800,000 on the provision of refurbishment works/improvement works to the property.   \n\t     \n\t   77. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   These parties have now been involved in bitter contested litigation for a number of years.  It is time it ended.  The parties wanted it to end when they met in Dusseldorf on 20 May 2022.  I now expect it to end on the terms of that Dusseldorf Agreement.  After all, both parties were content with it as a proper solution as recently as 20 May 2022.  They even toasted it with champagne.  I do believe that Valentin will do everything in his power to ensure it is now fully acted upon.  I am grateful to him for that.  It is vital to his mother's future and I very much want his relationship with her to be restored after this immensely damaging process.  I very much hope the Husband will see the sense in this as well.   \n\t     \n\t     \n\t 78. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I want to pay tribute to all the assistance I have had with this difficult case.  Nothing more could have been said or done on behalf of either party. \n\t    "

Thus, communications between the parties of a sexual nature may well be relevant as may communications between them either before or after the relevant incident or time period. That approach is in keeping with the court's obligation to consider the wide canvas of evidence and its duty to have regard to patterns of behaviour - both of the complainant and the alleged perpetrator - as described in  Re H-N .

The mother had sought JÄôs return to her care, but I concluded that this would not be in JÄôs best interests. Though the mother was more than capable of providing good physical care for J and loved her deeply, the motherÄôs oral evidence gave rise to serious concern. She appeared to have accepted some of the findings I made following the February 2018 hearing. However, having heard her oral evidence, I formed the view that her acceptance was limited and insufficient. I did not believe the information she had given represented a final, full, and honest account of what occurred in 2015 and thereafter. Such an account was necessary to inform any evaluation of risk. Though she had engaged with therapy, I concluded she was merely at the start of a lengthy process of personal change and that J could not wait for that process to be complete. Were J to be returned to her motherÄôs care, I concluded that the risks could not be safely managed.  \n\t  "

    "section_texts" : [ "115 Special guardianship (1) After section 14 of the 1989 Act there is inserted' Special guardianship 14A Special guardianship orders (1) A ' special guardianship order ' is an order appointing one or more individuals to be a child's ' special guardian ' (or special guardians). (2) A special guardian' (a) must be aged eighteen or over; and (b) must not be a parent of the child in question, and subsections (3) to (6) are to be read in that light. (3) The court may make a special guardianship order with respect to any child on the application of an individual who' (a) is entitled to make such an application with respect to the child; or (b) has obtained the leave of the court to make the application, or on the joint application of more than one such individual. (4) Section 9(3) applies in relation to an application for leave to apply for a special guardianship order as it applies in relation to an application for leave to apply for a section 8 order. (5) The individuals who are entitled to apply for a special guardianship order with respect to a child are' (a) any guardian of the child; (b) any individual in whose favour a residence order is in force with respect to the child; (c) any individual listed in subsection (5)(b) or (c) of section 10 (as read with subsection (10) of that section); (d) a local authority foster parent with whom the child has lived for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the application. (6) The court may also make a special guardianship order with respect to a child in any family proceedings in which a question arises with respect to the welfare of the child if' (a) an application for the order has been made by an individual who falls within subsection (3)(a) or (b) (or more than one such individual jointly); or (b) the court considers that a special guardianship order should be made even though no such application has been made. (7) No individual may make an application under subsection (3) or (6)(a) unless, before the beginning of the period of three months ending with the date of the application, he has given written notice of his intention to make the application' (a) if the child in question is being looked after by a local authority, to that local authority, or (b) otherwise, to the local authority in whose area the individual is ordinarily resident. (8) On receipt of such a notice, the local authority must investigate the matter and prepare a report for the court dealing with' (a) the suitability of the applicant to be a special guardian; (b) such matters (if any) as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State; and (c) any other matter which the local authority consider to be relevant. (9) The court may itself ask a local authority to conduct such an investigation and prepare such a report, and the local authority must do so. (10) The local authority may make such arrangements as they see fit for any person to act on their behalf in connection with conducting an investigation or preparing a report referred to in subsection (8) or (9). (11) The court may not make a special guardianship order unless it has received a report dealing with the matters referred to in subsection (8). (12) Subsections (8) and (9) of section 10 apply in relation to special guardianship orders as they apply in relation to section 8 orders. (13) This section is subject to section 29(5) and (6) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. 14B Special guardianship orders: making (1) Before making a special guardianship order, the court must consider whether, if the order were made' (a) a contact order should also be made with respect to the child, and (b) any section 8 order in force with respect to the child should be varied or discharged. (2) On making a special guardianship order, the court may also' (a) give leave for the child to be known by a new surname; (b) grant the leave required by section 14C(3)(b), either generally or for specified purposes. 14C Special guardianship orders: effect (1) The effect of a special guardianship order is that while the order remains in force' (a) a special guardian appointed by the order has parental responsibility for the child in respect of whom it is made; and (b) subject to any other order in force with respect to the child under this Act, a special guardian is entitled to exercise parental responsibility to the exclusion of any other person with parental responsibility for the child (apart from another special guardian). (2) Subsection (1) does not affect' (a) the operation of any enactment or rule of law which requires the consent of more than one person with parental responsibility in a matter affecting the child; or (b) any rights which a parent of the child has in relation to the child's adoption or placement for adoption. (3) While a special guardianship order is in force with respect to a child, no person may' (a) cause the child to be known by a new surname; or (b) remove him from the United Kingdom, without either the written consent of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the court. (4) Subsection (3)(b) does not prevent the removal of a child, for a period of less than three months, by a special guardian of his. (5) If the child with respect to whom a special guardianship order is in force dies, his special guardian must take reasonable steps to give notice of that fact to' (a) each parent of the child with parental responsibility; and (b) each guardian of the child, but if the child has more than one special guardian, and one of them has taken such steps in relation to a particular parent or guardian, any other special guardian need not do so as respects that parent or guardian. (6) This section is subject to section 29(7) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. 14D Special guardianship orders: variation and discharge (1) The court may vary or discharge a special guardianship order on the application of' (a) the special guardian (or any of them, if there are more than one); (b) any parent or guardian of the child concerned; (c) any individual in whose favour a residence order is in force with respect to the child; (d) any individual not falling within any of paragraphs (a) to (c) who has, or immediately before the making of the special guardianship order had, parental responsibility for the child; (e) the child himself; or (f) a local authority designated in a care order with respect to the child. (2) In any family proceedings in which a question arises with respect to the welfare of a child with respect to whom a special guardianship order is in force, the court may also vary or discharge the special guardianship order if it considers that the order should be varied or discharged, even though no application has been made under subsection (1). (3) The following must obtain the leave of the court before making an application under subsection (1)' (a) the child; (b) any parent or guardian of his; (c) any step-parent of his who has acquired, and has not lost, parental responsibility for him by virtue of section 4A; (d) any individual falling within subsection (1)(d) who immediately before the making of the special guardianship order had, but no longer has, parental responsibility for him. (4) Where the person applying for leave to make an application under subsection (1) is the child, the court may only grant leave if it is satisfied that he has sufficient understanding to make the proposed application under subsection (1). (5) The court may not grant leave to a person falling within subsection (3)(b)(c) or (d) unless it is satisfied that there has been a significant change in circumstances since the making of the special guardianship order. 14E Special guardianship orders: supplementary (1) In proceedings in which any question of making, varying or discharging a special guardianship order arises, the court shall (in the light of any rules made by virtue of subsection (3))' (a) draw up a timetable with a view to determining the question without delay; and (b) give such directions as it considers appropriate for the purpose of ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the timetable is adhered to. (2) Subsection (1) applies also in relation to proceedings in which any other question with respect to a special guardianship order arises. (3) The power to make rules in subsection (2) of section 11 applies for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of that. (4) A special guardianship order, or an order varying one, may contain provisions which are to have effect for a specified period. (5) Section 11(7) (apart from paragraph (c)) applies in relation to special guardianship orders and orders varying them as it applies in relation to section 8 orders. 14F Special guardianship support services (1) Each local authority must make arrangements for the provision within their area of special guardianship support services, which means' (a) counselling, advice and information; and (b) such other services as are prescribed, in relation to special guardianship. (2) The power to make regulations under subsection (1)(b) is to be exercised so as to secure that local authorities provide financial support. (3) At the request of any of the following persons' (a) a child with respect to whom a special guardianship order is in force; (b) a special guardian; (c) a parent; (d) any other person who falls within a prescribed description, a local authority may carry out an assessment of that person's needs for special guardianship support services (but, if the Secretary of State so provides in regulations, they must do so if he is a person of a prescribed description, or if his case falls within a prescribed description, or if both he and his case fall within prescribed descriptions). (4) A local authority may, at the request of any other person, carry out an assessment of that person's needs for special guardianship support services. (5) Where, as a result of an assessment, a local authority decide that a person has needs for special guardianship support services, they must then decide whether to provide any such services to that person. (6) If' (a) a local authority decide to provide any special guardianship support services to a person, and (b) the circumstances fall within a prescribed description, the local authority must prepare a plan in accordance with which special guardianship support services are to be provided to him, and keep the plan under review. (7) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about assessments, preparing and reviewing plans, the provision of special guardianship support services in accordance with plans and reviewing the provision of special guardianship support services. (8) The regulations may in particular make provision' (a) about the type of assessment which is to be carried out, or the way in which an assessment is to be carried out; (b) about the way in which a plan is to be prepared; (c) about the way in which, and the time at which, a plan or the provision of special guardianship support services is to be reviewed; (d) about the considerations to which a local authority are to have regard in carrying out an assessment or review or preparing a plan; (e) as to the circumstances in which a local authority may provide special guardianship support services subject to conditions (including conditions as to payment for the support or the repayment of financial support); (f) as to the consequences of conditions imposed by virtue of paragraph (e) not being met (including the recovery of any financial support provided); (g) as to the circumstances in which this section may apply to a local authority in respect of persons who are outside that local authority's area; (h) as to the circumstances in which a local authority may recover from another local authority the expenses of providing special guardianship support services to any person. (9) A local authority may provide special guardianship support services (or any part of them) by securing their provision by' (a) another local authority; or (b) a person within a description prescribed in regulations of persons who may provide special guardianship support services, and may also arrange with any such authority or person for that other authority or that person to carry out the local authority's functions in relation to assessments under this section. (10) A local authority may carry out an assessment of the needs of any person for the purposes of this section at the same time as an assessment of his needs is made under any other provision of this Act or under any other enactment. (11) Section 27 (co-operation between authorities) applies in relation to the exercise of functions of a local authority under this section as it applies in relation to the exercise of functions of a local authority under Part 3. 14G Special guardianship support services: representations (1) Every local authority shall establish a procedure for considering representations (including complaints) made to them by any person to whom they may provide special guardianship support services about the discharge of their functions under section 14F in relation to him. (2) Regulations may be made by the Secretary of State imposing time limits on the making of representations under subsection (1). (3) In considering representations under subsection (1), a local authority shall comply with regulations (if any) made by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this subsection. (2) The 1989 Act is amended as follows. (3) In section 1 (welfare of the child), in subsection (4)(b), after 'discharge' there is inserted ' a special guardianship order or ' . (4) In section 5 (appointment of guardians)' (a) in subsection (1)' (i) in paragraph (b), for 'or guardian' there is substituted ' , guardian or special guardian ' , and (ii) at the end of paragraph (b) there is inserted ; or (c) paragraph (b) does not apply, and the child's only or last surviving special guardian dies. , (b) in subsection (4), at the end there is inserted ' ; and a special guardian of a child may appoint another individual to be the child's guardian in the event of his death ' , and (c) in subsection (7), at the end of paragraph (b) there is inserted ' or he was the child's only (or last surviving) special guardian ' ." ] ,

The insidious nature of coercive and controlling relationships is such that the victim remains vulnerable to the abuser's influence and will often return to the abusive relationship.  In the UK, M has a number of protective factors that reduce the likelihood of her returning to F, chief among which are the physical distance from F and the support she has with her parents, family and friends in the UK.  Both of those will be lost if she returns to Slovakia.  Nothing this court can do can guarantee that M will not return to F.   But I am quite satisfied that by returning EF and, by extension, M to Slovakia the court would unacceptably increase the risk of M falling once again under F's malign influence.  Accordingly, having evaluated the available protective measures I remain satisfied a return to Slovakia would give rise to a grave risk of harm within the meaning of Article 13(b)."

In  Some Sunlight Seeps In  [2022] FRJ 79, Sir James Munby explained why at  93: \n\t     \n\t   \n\t       \n\t   'In the event, the Court of Appeal, having conducted the same balancing exercise, came to a different conclusion: there should be no anonymisation. In other words, the Court of Appeal was acknowledging the significance of the rule change in 2009 and identifying the essential task for the court as being ' and this in a case where the issue was whether or not there should be anonymisation ' to undertake the balancing exercise mandated by the Convention. The ratio of the decision was that both the first instance and appeal judgments would be published without anonymity, in particular because, having undertaken the balancing exercise, the husband had behaved badly. The general practice favouring anonymisation was not an essential reason for the decision; on the contrary that practice was of no relevance to the specific facts of that case which in the final analysis, were decisive. Those specific facts meant that anonymisation would not be applied.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t   The irony of all this will not have escaped the reader. In both  \n\t     Clibbery v Allan  and  Lykiardopulo v Lykiardopulo , the decisions of the Court of Appeal most frequently cited in support of the conventional pieties, the actual ratio was that proposed prohibition of publication or anonymisation is to be resolved having regard to and balancing the interests of the parties and the public as protected by Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention, considered in the particular circumstances of the case.'"

The positive obligation that arises for public authorities under Arts 2 and 3 in cases such as this was explained by Lord Stephens in the Supreme Court in  \n\t   Re T  [2021] UKSC 35  at paragraphs 175 and 176. The discharge of this positive obligation is currently being left to the court and to individual local authorities, yet neither of these agencies has access to the necessary resources to meet this obligation, nor, in the case of the court, the knowledge or real expertise to do so. One consequence of the lack of sufficient secure placements is that local authorities turn to the High Court to authorise a DOLS placement in other accommodation, often at very significant additional cost. Frequently, as the reported judgments describe, and as X's circumstances demonstrate, the accommodation that is authorised via DOLS is not appropriate to meet the young person's needs and is simply chosen as being the 'least worse', and often the only, option that is available."

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 7. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   The leading judgment on the issue is  \n\t   Re W (children) (abuse)  UKSC 12, and the speech of Lady Hale, in particular at paragraphs 22-28:  \n\t     \n\t   '22. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     However, tempting it may be to leave the issue until it has received the expert scrutiny of a multi-disciplinary committee, we are satisfied that we cannot do so. The existing law erects a presumption against a child giving evidence which requires to be rebutted by anyone seeking to put questions to the child. That cannot be reconciled with the approach of the European Court of Human Rights, which always aims to strike a fair balance between competing Convention rights. Article 6 requires that the proceedings overall be fair and this normally entails an opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other side. But even in criminal proceedings account must be taken of the article 8 rights of the perceived victim: see SN v Sweden, App no 34209/96, 2 July 2002. Striking that balance in care proceedings may well mean that the child should not be called to give evidence in the great majority of cases, but that is a result and not a presumption or even a starting point. \n\t     \n\t   23. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The object of the proceedings is to achieve a fair trial in the determination of the rights of all the people involved. Children are harmed if they are taken away from their families for no good reason. Children are harmed if they are left in abusive families. This means that the court must admit all the evidence which bears upon the relevant questions: whether the threshold criteria justifying state intervention have been proved; if they have, what action if any will be in the best interests of the child? The court cannot ignore relevant evidence just because other evidence might have been better. It will have to do the best it can on what it has. \n\t     \n\t   24. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     When the court is considering whether a particular child should be called as a witness, the court will have to weigh two considerations: the advantages that that will bring to the determination of the truth and the damage it may do to the welfare of this or any other child. A fair trial is a trial which is fair in the light of the issues which have to be decided. Mr Geekie accepts that the welfare of the child is also a relevant consideration, albeit not the paramount consideration in this respect. He is right to do so, because the object of the proceedings is to promote the welfare of this and other children. The hearing cannot be fair to them unless their interests are given great weight. \n\t     \n\t   25. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     In weighing the advantages that calling the child to give evidence may bring to the fair and accurate determination of the case, the court will have to look at several factors. One will be the issues it has to decide in order properly to determine the case. Sometimes it may be possible to decide the case without making findings on particular allegations. Another will be the quality of the evidence it already has. Sometimes there may be enough evidence to make the findings needed whether or not the child is cross-examined. Sometimes there will be nothing useful to be gained from the child's oral evidence. The case is built upon a web of behaviour, drawings, stray remarks, injuries and the like, and not upon concrete allegations voiced by the child. The quality of any ABE interview will also be an important factor, as will be the nature of any challenge which the party may wish to make. The court is unlikely to be helped by generalised accusations of lying, or by a fishing expedition in which the child is taken slowly through the story yet again in the hope that something will turn up, or by a cross- examination which is designed to intimidate the child and pave the way for accusations of inconsistency in a future criminal trial. On the other hand, focussed questions which put forward a different explanation for certain events may help the court to do justice between the parties. Also relevant will be the age and maturity of the child and the length of time since the events in question, for these will have a bearing on whether an account now can be as reliable as a near-contemporaneous account, especially if given in a well-conducted ABE interview. \n\t     \n\t   26. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The age and maturity of the child, along with the length of time since the events in question, will also be relevant to the second part of the inquiry, which is the risk of harm to the child. Further specific factors may be the support which the child has from family or other sources, or the lack of it, the child's own wishes and feelings about giving evidence, and the views of the child's guardian and, where appropriate, those with parental responsibility. We endorse the view that an unwilling child should rarely, if ever, be obliged to give evidence. The risk of further delay to the proceedings is also a factor: there is a general principle that delay in determining any question about a child's upbringing is likely to prejudice his welfare: see  Children Act 1989 ,  s 1(2) . There may also be specific risks of harm to this particular child. Where there are parallel criminal proceedings, the likelihood of the child having to give evidence twice may increase the risk of harm. The parent may be seeking to put his child through this ordeal in order to strengthen his hand in the criminal proceedings rather than to enable the family court to get at the truth. On the other hand, as the family court has to give less weight to the evidence of a child because she has not been called, then that may be damaging too. However, the court is entitled to have regard to the general evidence of the harm which giving evidence may do to children, as well as to any features which are particular to this child and this case. That risk of harm is an ever-present feature to which, on the present evidence, the court must give great weight. The risk, and therefore the weight, may vary from case to case, but the court must always take it into account and does not need expert evidence in order to do so. \n\t     \n\t   27. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     But on both sides of the equation, the court must factor in what steps can be taken to improve the quality of the child's evidence and at the same time to decrease the risk of harm to the child. These two aims are not in opposition to one another. The whole premise of Achieving Best Evidence and the special measures in criminal cases is that this will improve rather than diminish the quality of the evidence to the court. It does not assume that the most reliable account of any incident is one made from recollection months or years later in the stressful conditions of a courtroom. Nor does it assume that an 'Old Bailey style' cross examination is the best way of testing that evidence. It may be the best way of casting doubt upon it in the eyes of a jury but that is another matter. A family court would have to be astute both to protect the child from the harmful and destructive effects of questioning and also to evaluate the answers in the light of the child's stage of development. \n\t     \n\t 28. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The family court will have to be realistic in evaluating how effective it can be in maximising the advantage while minimising the harm. There are things that the court can do but they are not things that it is used to doing at present. It is not limited by the usual courtroom procedures or to applying the special measures by analogy. The important thing is that the questions which challenge the child's account are fairly put to the child so that she can answer them, not that counsel should be able to question her directly. One possibility is an early video'd cross examination as proposed by Pigot. Another is cross-examination via video link. But another is putting the required questions to her through an intermediary. This could be the court itself, as would be common in continental Europe and used to be much more common than it is now in the courts of this country.'"

The fact that adult parents had previously or subsequently engaged in consensual sexual activity of any sort does not mean that they were not raped or sexually assaulted on another occasion. However, evidence as to the parents' sexual relationship may be logically probative of an allegation of partnership rape or sexual assault. Thus, communications between the parties of a sexual nature may well be relevant as may communications between them either before or after the relevant incident or time period. That approach is in keeping with the court's obligation to consider the wide canvas of evidence and its duty to have regard to patterns of behaviour - both of the complainant and the alleged perpetrator - as described in  Re H-N . It does not give an alleged perpetrator permission to produce any material that they wish if it is irrelevant and, if relevant, where it fails to meet the approach articulated in [23] of  Dunn v Durham County Council ."

Alternatively, it is proposed that the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction to terminate the parental responsibility or rely on the public policy exception within Art 22 of the 1996 Hague Convention.  The position of the Secretary of State remains to be definitively articulated, the reason for his adjournment application being the need to consult across a number of government departments in circumstances where the outcome of this case could have wide ramifications.

Finally, there is nothing in the legislative history of  the 1990 Act  that suggests Parliament considered this situation, where the donor has not been given the opportunity to fulfil the requirements of paragraph 1 Schedule 3.

It is important to stress that the reference is to the views and opinions of the parents.

In  \n\t     Gard and Others v the United Kingdom  - 39793/17 (Decision [2017] ECHR 605 (27 June 2017) the ECtHR identified the requirements that the state has to meet to satisfy its positive obligations under Art 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights in a case where life sustaining treatment is to be withdrawn: \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     \"[80] In addressing the question of the administering or withdrawal of medical treatment ï¿½Ä¶ the Court has taken into account the following elements: \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     - the existence in domestic law and practice of a regulatory framework compatible with the requirements of Article 2; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t     \n\t\t \n\t     - whether account had been taken of the applicant's previously expressed wishes and those of the persons close to him, as well as the opinions of other medical personnel; \n\t       \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     - the possibility to approach the courts in the event of doubts as to the best decision to take in the patient's interests.' \n\t       \n\t     \n\t \n\t       \n\t     In any event the parents have Article 8 rights and their wishes have to be taken into account in that context.

I also bear in mind that Ms Parfitt has an Article 8 right to family life which ought to be considered. If so, parental wishes are not 'wholly irrelevant'.

There is, however, a difficult issue as to whether I should make any interim declarations concerning the lawfulness of the restrictions that the Local Authority wishes to have applied to CC in advance of that trial.  It was accepted by all parties that I have to approach that matter on a conventional American Cyanamid basis, namely to ask first whether the Local Authority has an arguable case to support its claim that the Court, after examining all the evidence, will conclude that a DOLS order should be made and, if I accept that the Local Authority has established an arguable case, I should look to the balance of convenience.  However, as the argument progressed, it became clear that the outcome of this interim relief application may well be determinative because I was told that if the Local Authority fail to secure a DOLS order, they are fearful that Cambian Group PLC ('Cambian') which operates the Placement will be minded to serve notice to terminate the Placement.  That consideration may affect the balance of convenience but it also means that I should have a more acute focus on which party is likely to be successful at the final hearing as this judgment might prove to be determinative.  I also consider that, if there is an issue of law to consider which will not be affected by the facts found at trial, if I reach a clear view on the resolution of that issue of law, it would save all parties time and money if that issue of law was considered now as opposed to being delayed to the trial. \n\t  "

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t \n\t     \n\t   \n\t   My overall conclusions \n\t     \n\t   59. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to my conclusions.  I am going to start by considering the various factors that I am directed by  \n\t     section 16(2)  of  the 1984 Act  to have particular regard to.  First, I will consider the connection which the parties to the marriage have to this jurisdiction.  I am clear that there is sufficient connection in this case for me to make a financial award in principle.  The parties had a home here.  Even though it was on a short-lease, the Husband demonstrated that he could extend that lease by doing so in 2016.  Valentin was educated here at Millfield and then at the European Business School in London.  At least initially, the medical procedures relating to his heart difficulties took place here.   The parties visited here regularly.  The Wife was very attached to this country and decided to make her life here when the marriage broke down.  Whether this was, originally, a tactical decision or not, I am satisfied that she does now intend to live here indefinitely.   \n\t     \n\t   60. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Turning to their connection with Germany, it is, of course, the case that they are both German.  They were born there.  They lived there pretty constantly until the year 2000.  They married there.  They had a Pre-Marital Agreement there. Even after they left for Switzerland, they retained connections with Germany.  I gave examples in my previous judgment but, for these purposes, I will merely note the Wife's continuing attachment to her German hairdresser, Marianne and the long-standing role performed by Dr Maschmeier on behalf of the Husband.  Nevertheless, I cannot ignore the fact that they left Germany in 2000, primarily for tax reasons.  Such moves occur in so many of the financial remedy cases that I hear.  The super-rich do appear to consider that such moves have no adverse consequences whatsoever.  I do not agree.  When it comes to Part III applications, it is relevant to my consideration that Germany was abandoned as a place of residence twenty-two years ago.  It follows that I do not consider the German links to be so strong as to prevent me from making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   61. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I must next consider their connection to Switzerland.  There is no doubt that the Husband lives there.  Valentin lives and works there as well.  The Husband's children by his first marriage also reside there.  I have not investigated just how deep the Husband's roots are in Switzerland.  I did, however, investigate those of the Wife in my previous judgment and I found that she did not integrate in that country; was deeply unhappy there; and could not wait to leave following the breakdown of the marriage.   Again, I am clear that the Swiss connection does not prevent me making an order in this case. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   62. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I now turn to the financial benefit that the Wife has received or is likely to receive outside this jurisdiction.  The answer is that, at least in the German divorce proceedings, she has received no benefit at all.  This is, of course, because she instructed her German lawyers to ensure her claims were dismissed.  The Husband says that this is equivalent to omitting to apply at all, which has to be considered under  \n\t     section 16(2) (f).  I must, therefore, consider whether she was justified in the stance that she took.  In this regard, I can come to reasonably clear conclusions.  I am satisfied that, pursuant to German law, the Wife would not have been awarded any capital provision at all.  This was because of a mixture of the Pre-Marital Agreement and the fact that there was no marital acquest.  I am satisfied that, even if she had succeeded in setting aside the Pre-Marital Agreement, it would have only been to enable her to receive maintenance.  Given the indication of Judge Block, on the balance of probabilities, I find that she would have done so, but not to obtain a capital award.  I am equally clear that the level of maintenance that she would then have received would have been modest.  At a maximum, she would have obtained an order equivalent to the sum the Husband was paying voluntarily but certainly not ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum or ï¿½Ç¨400,000 per annum.  To achieve a capital award, she would have had to change the law, as Mrs White did here.  I am clear that she was told by the Husband that he would contest this all the way and that it would take ten years, as she would have to go to the Federal Court in Germany, without any guarantee of a successful outcome.  I have no doubt he made this abundantly clear to her.  As it was said via his lawyers, it cannot be asserted that this was undue pressure but it was pressure and she succumbed.  I am clear that it was not unreasonable for her to do so.  Whether she was unreasonable not to conclude a deal with him in Germany, given that he was making offers far in excess of what she could have obtained in court, is an entirely different matter.  Fortunately, I do not need to answer it, given the existence of the May 2022 Dusseldorf Agreement.  It follows that I do not consider the fact that she asked the German Court to dismiss her claims to be fatal to her application here.   \n\t     \n\t   63. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst I have dealt with the provision she received in the German divorce proceedings, that does not cover any financial benefit which she has received or is likely to receive in Germany by virtue of an agreement.  In dealing with this, I do, of course, accept that she has repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  I have not heard expert evidence as to the law in Germany, but I consider it reasonable to assume that it will be the same as our contract law.  In other words, following the repudiation, she cannot change her mind and enforce the Agreement.  That does not mean that the Husband could not do so, but I consider it highly unlikely that he would attempt to do so now.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the provision agreed in Dusseldorf was something that she could have enforced on 23 May 2022, if she had gone down that route rather than repudiating the Agreement.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   64. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I therefore turn to consider the circumstances of the signing of the Agreement, applying the dicta in  \n\t     Edgar v Edgar .  I find that the Wife was extremely keen to conclude an agreement with the Husband.  I cannot see that he had nearly the same incentive as her.  I accept that Valentin was also keen to see if he could broker a settlement.  I am satisfied that the initial idea for the meeting came from the Wife.  She pressed for it.  She was willing to go both to Zurich and Dusseldorf to obtain an agreement.  She did so entirely willingly and without any pressure.  I find that she wanted to encourage the Husband to engage.  She knew that he did not want her lawyers involved, so she was happy to say that she would keep it secret from them.  I do not find she was pressurised to do so.  I do accept that Valentin's question about her wanting to tell her lawyers was designed to obtain a confirmation that she would not do so, but she agreed without being forced to do so.  In other words, it was not a condition of the meetings.  In fact, she eventually broke this promise by telling Mr Westley on 11 May 2022, although she did not do so at the consultation with Mr Chamberlayne on 9 May 2022.  I simply cannot speculate as to what happened when she told Mr Westley, other than to note that it did not prevent her going to Dusseldorf. It follows that I find that it was her choice to negotiate without Mr Westley or Mr Chamberlayne.  Whilst  Edgar  specifically refers to the lack of legal advice as being a potential reason for not enforcing such an agreement, I accept that the law has moved on since then and, in particular, following the decision of the Supreme Court in  Radmacher v Granatino   [2010] UKSC 42 .  The absence of legal advice is not fatal, if the unrepresented party has a proper appreciation of the Agreement reached.  I find that this Wife undoubtedly did have such a proper appreciation.  \n\t     \n\t   65. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I next turn to the second aspect, namely the asserted threats that she would get nothing if she did not sign the Dusseldorf Agreement.  The first point to make is that the Wife has, throughout, been aware of potential significant enforcement difficulties.  She had seen the three opinions which had been served further to the Husband's submissions opposing her application for permission to make this application.  She knew that it was one of the three reasons why it was said by him that I should not give leave.  I do not, of course, know what advice she received but it will not have been a surprise to her that this was relied on by both the Husband and Valentin.  I am satisfied that they did rely on it, but I am not satisfied that they took unfair advantage of this fact.  After all, the Husband was offering significant provision to the Wife.  If he had really intended to play hard-ball, I consider his offer would have been much lower than it was.  I am satisfied that the Wife was under pressure.  All litigants are under pressure as litigation is costly with no certainty of success.  I accept that she was under more pressure than the Husband who had very little to lose.  Nevertheless, on the balance of probabilities, I have come to the conclusion that the Wife was not under 'undue pressure' as described in  \n\t     Edgar .  In reaching this conclusion, I have been particularly influenced by her demeanour as described by both Valentin and Dr Maschmeier.  She was not some 'supplicant cowed into submission' by a bullying husband and son.  She was the driving force behind the meetings taking place at all.  She went not once but twice.  On the second occasion, she went notwithstanding having spoken to her lawyer about the first meeting.  I have accepted Dr Maschmeier's evidence as to what happened when he arrived.  She did not seem upset, disappointed or distressed at all.  The opposite was the case.  She was very relieved.  At the time, she considered the Agreement to be a good result.  She engaged entirely voluntarily with the champagne toast.  She was not desperate to leave.  Her comment about signing her death warrant was humorous and light-hearted.  It may have reflected some nagging doubts, but no more than that. She had reached an agreement with her Husband voluntarily and with her eyes open. I am fortified in this conclusion when I remind myself that I am also specifically directed to consider the extent to which any imposed order here would be likely to be enforceable.  Given that enforceability is an issue that I am required to consider, I find it difficult to see how I could say that raising the issue would be fatal to any subsequent agreement reached.   \n\t     \n\t   66. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do, however, take the view that I should consider the terms of the Agreement reached in the light of this Part III application.  I am clear that the provision set out in the Dusseldorf Agreement is very much within the bracket of possible awards that I might have made had there been no meetings in Zurich or Dusseldorf.  It follows that it certainly cannot be said that unfair or undue pressure caused the Wife to sign an Agreement that was unfair or outside the range of possible orders she could have got from the court.  I have already referred to my decision in  \n\t     MA v SK  in which I decided that the facts of that case meant that I should make an award that was 'needs light'.  I am clear that exactly the same sort of considerations apply here.  \n\t     \n\t   67. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If I had simply started with a blank sheet of paper, I am clear that I would have taken the view that a suitable London property for the Wife would have been Kinnerton Street.  If this had been an entirely English case, she would have received a considerably more valuable property, but it is not.  I cannot ignore the provision she would have got in Germany.  I would have taken the view that the freehold should be acquired or that the lease should be extended by thirty-five years as suggested by Mr Chamberlayne in his closing submissions.  I am equally clear that I would have considered it reasonable to refurbish/renovate the property and that the sum of ï¿½ï¿½800,000 to ï¿½ï¿½1 million would be appropriate.  The one likely departure from the Agreement is that I would have found that the property should be owned by the Wife, not by Valentin, but that is certainly not fatal.  There is always give and take in reaching an Agreement.  Provided the Wife has absolute security of occupation throughout her lifetime, there is no significant prejudice to her in the property being in the name of her son.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   68. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I would also have come to the conclusion that she should have a second home in the country.  In my judgment in the divorce proceedings, I mentioned this second home being in Germany but it is, of course, entirely up to the Wife where she has such a second home.  I am satisfied that, even allowing for the Part III considerations, a second home would be appropriate in a case where the parties had been married for 32 years and the Husband was worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.  I made such a finding in  \n\t     MA v SK  and I would have done so here.  The quantum of the provision, however, is a very different matter.  I would not have considered that the home should be the sort of home regularly occupied by multi-millionaires in the Home Counties.  I would have considered that a more modest property would be appropriate.  The capital award agreed was ï¿½Ç¨3 million.   At the current rate of exchange, this is just over ï¿½ï¿½2.5 million.  The Wife needs to discharge her liabilities in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½230,000.  She would therefore have just under ï¿½ï¿½2 million for a property, taking into account the costs of purchase.  I could not possibly say that this would be unreasonable given the Husband's property particular of Manor Farm House, Frilford, Oxon at a guide price of ï¿½ï¿½1.25 million.  I do accept that I do not know how much work would be required to that property but, in principle, the lump sum agreed would meet her 'needs light', even if she wanted to retain part of the money, previously described in our courts as a  Besterman  cushion.  I do, of course, accept that I would not have given the Husband a year to pay the second instalment but, as the price of obtaining enforceability, I consider this delay to be a small price to pay. \n\t     \n\t   69. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Finally, I turn to maintenance. I accept that the standard of living was immensely high in this case.  Nevertheless, I could not have ignored the likely quantum of an order in Germany.  It would definitely have served to reduce downwards my award.  In Germany, the Husband had originally offered ï¿½Ç¨300,000 per annum whilst the Wife sought ï¿½ï¿½600,000 per annum.  I consider the agreed figure of ï¿½Ç¨480,000, which is currently equivalent to just over ï¿½ï¿½400,000 per annum, undoubtedly to be within the appropriate bracket.  I very much doubt my award would have been higher.  I suspect it might have been somewhat lower, given that I ordered ï¿½ï¿½225,000 per annum in  \n\t     MA v SK .   \n\t     \n\t   70. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   I do take the view that I would have been likely to capitalise the payment.  This would be in accordance with  \n\t     the Act  that requires me to have this as my objective.  It would be in accordance with the authorities.  After all, I capitalised the maintenance in  MA v SK .  Capitalisation is clearly possible in this case given that the Husband accepts he is worth ï¿½Ç¨180 million.   I do not, however, consider that this likelihood would mean that I would never have made a periodical payments order.  I am required to consider the position in Germany and the extent of the enforceability of my award.  Suppose the Husband had attended in my court and told me that he wanted to be generous and would agree to an order in the sum of ï¿½Ç¨480,000 per annum, provided it was not capitalised.  I consider it at least possible that I would have agreed.  In any event, that is not the test.  The Agreement was a compromise. The Wife traded the probability of obtaining a capitalised lump sum from me and the possibility that she might enforce that order, for the certainty of generous monthly maintenance provision. I would not even hesitate in finding that such a decision was a reasonable one for her to adopt.   \n\t     \n\t   71. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     By way of one final cross-check, I intend just to cover briefly the capital value of the Agreement if it had been ordered outright.  Before doing so, I remind myself that my award in  \n\t     MA v SK  was ï¿½ï¿½10 million in late 2014, which would equate to around ï¿½ï¿½12.75 million today.  The Dusseldorf Agreement would be worth a very similar sum, namely:- \n\t       \n\t     (a) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Kinnerton Street (freehold/long leasehold) \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½4,100,000 \n\t       \n\t     (b) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Works to Kinnerton Street \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½   900,000 \n\t       \n\t     (c) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Lump sum of ï¿½Ç¨3 million \n\t       ï¿½ï¿½2,500,000 \n\t       \n\t     (d) \n\t       \n\t\t \n\t     Capitalised value of maintenance ( \n\t       Duxbury) ï¿½ï¿½4,750,000 \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     Total \n\t                 ï¿½ï¿½12,250,000 \n\t     \n\t 72. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   For me, the huge tragedy of this case is that the Wife repudiated the Dusseldorf Agreement.  She clearly had 'buyer's remorse' but the risks of repudiation were extremely high.  I have already found it likely that the legal effect in Germany of repudiation would be to make the Agreement unenforceable.  The Husband, however, has made much of his wish to do the right thing by this Wife, to whom he was married for over thirty years and with whom he had his only son.  I decided in his favour in 2019.  In one sense, I have done so again by coming to the conclusion that the Dusseldorf Agreement should be enforced. I do so on the assumption and belief that he will now abide by the terms of the Agreement and the order that I intend to make. \n\t    "

I then said that Dr Abdullah was expected to receive ï¿½ï¿½1,096,750 from Albion Gate; ï¿½ï¿½308,750 from The Piazza; and ï¿½ï¿½503,750 from Craven Street.  This would give her a net total of ï¿½ï¿½1,909,375 less the equitable accounting in relation to the UBS mortgage repayment.  However, in the Part III proceedings, I found that both Albion Gate and Craven Street were matrimonial homes.  I decided that I should direct that Dr Abdullah pay her a lump sum of ï¿½ï¿½767,042 to restore to her the sum she owed him as a result of equitable accounting, such that both parties received the same amount, which I calculated would be ï¿½ï¿½1,909,375 on the basis of sales at the market appraisals.  Finally, I made a contingent lump sum in favour of Dr Aldoukhi, if Shamu was ever successful in suing her for any debt claimed by Shamu against her.   "

As a minimum it seems to us that this means that the child is not undergoing the physical and consequential psychological changes which would contribute to the understanding of a personÄôs identity. There is an argument that for some children at least, this may confirm the childÄôs chosen gender identity at the time they begin the use of puberty blockers and to that extent, confirm their GD and increase the likelihood of some children moving on to cross-sex hormones.

'  They are words however that serve to remind with emphasis, a Court making this sort of decision that the child's welfare is paramount. I found echoes of this aspect in the Mother's statement of evidence in this case when she set out how she had tried in her own thinking about the decision to be made for Kwame to disentangle what she would want for herself from what would be the best thing for him.

In  Re E  Baroness Hale made clear at paragraphs 31- 37:  \n\t     \n\t   (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The burden of proof lies with the person opposing the return [32]. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   No need for elaboration or gloss to the reference to 'grave risk of harm'; by its terms it is of 'restricted application' [31] the risk must be grave [33].' \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   There was recognition that the term 'physical or psychological harm' are not qualified but they 'gain colour' from the alternative 'or otherwise' placed 'in an intolerable situation'. Whilst accepting a child will have to put up with a certain amount of 'rough and tumble, discomfort and distress' there are some things that it is not reasonable to expect them to tolerate. These include physical or psychological abuse or neglect and can include exposure to such behaviour [34]. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The analysis under article 13 b is looking to the future; the situation there would be if the child is returned to the home country which is not necessarily the same as being returned to the person seeking the child's return. The situation the child will face on return depends on the protective measures that can be put in place [35]. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t (v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Where the allegations relied upon are contested Baroness Hale stated as follows [36]  \n\t     ' Where allegations of domestic abuse are made, the court should first ask whether, if they are true, there would be a grave risk that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation. If so, the court must then ask how the child can be protected against the risk. The appropriate protective measures and their efficacy will obviously vary from case to case and from country to country. This is where arrangements for international co-operation between liaison judges are so helpful. Without such protective measures, the court may have no option but to do the best it can to resolve the disputed issues' . As has been later stated by Moylan LJ in  Re C (Children)(Abduction: Article 13b)   [2019] 1 FLR 1045  this does not mean no evaluative assessment of the allegations could or should be undertaken, with due caution being factored in when conducting a paper evaluation."

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 19. \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   Mr Metzer KC submitted that there was a need for a consistent approach to rape, sexual assault and consent relying on (a) a variety of published fact finding judgments which appeared to show contradictory approaches to the analysis of rape allegations in the family court and (b) the absence of a framework for determining such allegations within the FPR, Practice Direction 12J (Child Arrangements and Contact Orders: Domestic Abuse and Harm) ['PD12J']. He accepted that the definitions used by the family court should not mirror or reflect those in use within the criminal court and, in written argument, Mr Metzer KC set out a framework for the family court to apply when considering allegations of rape and sexual assault. His framework read as follows: \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   (a) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Rape should be defined as an absence of willingness to engage in sex. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (b) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Willingness is given freely and voluntarily. It may be demonstrated by verbal communication or other cues which must be active rather than passive. A willingness to have sex may not be inferred from silence or passivity. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (c) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   A person may be willing to have sex (or any lesser form of sexual contact) and they might change their mind at any stage prior to or even in the course of intercourse. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (d) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Mutuality, enjoyment, and welcomeness are indicators of consent. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (e) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The converse: unwanted sex that was not welcome or enjoyed are indicators of absence of consent and therefore rape. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (f) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   If there is an absence of willingness, lack of consent or submission is irrelevant, as the sex is not wanted. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (g) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   An absence of willingness would be found in cases where there is no freedom and capacity to make that choice, which could include those involving a child, an incapacitated person, a person whether intoxicated by drink and/or drugs, or a person threated by violence, deceived, or in fear. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (h) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   A person who simply freezes with no protest or resistance is unlikely to be consenting - violence or the threat thereof is not a necessary ingredient. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   For sex to happen when a party is not willing to have sex is profoundly abusive, which is the primary concern of the family court rather than the act fulfilling the strict constituent elements of a criminal offence. \n\t    "

In earlier days, in the case of  \n\t   Thynne , the rules were not as clear and detailed as they are now, and the inherent jurisdiction was more often resorted to by the court, to do right between the parties. There is no need to do that here. We have a rule, and, just as Sir James Munby relied upon the same rule in  M v P , it seems to me that that is the proper course for this court to take. I, therefore, propose to grant the order that is sought, thereby rectifying the decree nisi and the decree absolute, so that they record the marriage that was being dissolved as being the Spanish marriage of 1993, and that is my judgment."

(2) After Schedule 1 to that Act (inserted by section 71(2) above) insertÄî SCHEDULE 2 Female genital mutilation protection orders PART 1 England and Wales Power to make FGM protection order 1 (1) The court in England and Wales may make an order (an ÄúFGM protection orderÄù) for the purposes ofÄî (a) protecting a girl against the commission of a genital mutilation offence, or (b) protecting a girl against whom any such offence has been committed. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under this paragraph and, if so, in what manner, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including the need to secure the health, safety and well-being of the girl to be protected. (3) An FGM protection order may containÄî (a) such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements, and (b) such other terms, as the court considers appropriate for the purposes of the order.

(8) Regulations under sub-paragraph (7) are to be made by statutory instrument, and any such instrument is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. Power to make order in criminal proceedings 3 The court before which there are criminal proceedings in England and Wales for a genital mutilation offence may make an FGM protection order (without an application being made to it) ifÄî (a) the court considers that an FGM protection order should be made to protect a girl (whether or not the victim of the offence in relation to the criminal proceedings), and (b) a person who would be a respondent to any proceedings for an FGM protection order is a defendant in the criminal proceedings. Offence of breaching order 4 (1) A person who without reasonable excuse does anything that the person is prohibited from doing by an FGM protection order is guilty of an offence. (2) In the case of an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 5(1), a person can be guilty of an offence under this paragraph only in respect of conduct engaged in at a time when the person was aware of the existence of the order. (3) Where a person is convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct, the conduct is not punishable as a contempt of court. (4) A person cannot be convicted of an offence under this paragraph in respect of any conduct which has been punished as a contempt of court.

(7) Äú Enactment Äù includes an enactment contained in subordinate legislation within the meaning of the Interpretation Act 1978. Ex parte orders 5 (1) The court may, in any case where it is just and convenient to do so, make an FGM protection order even though the respondent has not been given such notice of the proceedings as would otherwise be required by rules of court. (2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under sub-paragraph (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the risk to the girl, or to another person, of becoming a victim of a genital mutilation offence if the order is not made immediately, (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately, and (c) whether there is reason to believe thatÄî (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service, and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the girl to be protected or (if different) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about an order made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1). (4) The opportunity must beÄî (a) as soon as just and convenient, and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court. Variation and discharge of orders 6 (1) The court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order on an application byÄî (a) any party to the proceedings for the order, (b) the girl being protected by the order (if not a party to the proceedings for the order), or (c) any person affected by the order.

(3) In addition, the court may vary or discharge an FGM protection order made by virtue of paragraph 2(1)(b) or 3 even though no application under sub-paragraph (1) above has been made to the court. (4) Paragraph 5 applies to a variation of an FGM protection order as it applies to the making of such an order (and references in that paragraph to the making of an FGM protection order are to be read accordingly). Arrest under warrant 7 (1) An interested party may apply to the relevant judge for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of a person if the interested party considers that the person has failed to comply with an FGM protection order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to such an order. (2) The relevant judge must not issue a warrant on an application under sub-paragraph (1) unlessÄî (a) the application is substantiated on oath, and (b) the relevant judge has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to be arrested has failed to comply with the order or is otherwise in contempt of court in relation to the order. (3) In this paragraph Äú interested party Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) the girl being protected by the order, (b) (if a different person) the person who applied for the order, or (c) any other person; but no application may be made under sub-paragraph (1) by a person falling within paragraph (c) without leave of the relevant judge. Remand: general 8 (1) The court before which an arrested person is brought by virtue of a warrant under paragraph 7 may, if the matter is not then disposed of immediately, remand the person concerned. (2) Paragraphs 9 to 14 contain further provision about the powers of a court to remand under this paragraph. (3) Sub-paragraph (4) applies if a person remanded under this paragraph is granted bail under paragraphs 10 to 14. (4) The person may be required by the relevant judge to comply, before release on bail or later, with such requirements as appear to the judge to be necessary to secure that the person does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Remand: medical examination and report 9 (1) Any power to remand a person under paragraph 8(1) may be exercised for the purpose of enabling a medical examination and report to be made if the relevant judge has reason to consider that a medical report will be required. (2) If such a power is so exercised, the adjournment must not be for more than four weeks at a time unless the relevant judge remands the accused in custody. (3) If the relevant judge remands the accused in custody, the adjournment must not be for more than three weeks at a time. (4) Sub-paragraph (5) applies if there is reason to suspect that a person who has been arrested under a warrant issued on an application under paragraph 7(1) is suffering from mental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. (5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Remand: further provision 10 (1) Where a court has power to remand a person under paragraph 8, the court may remand the person in custody or on bail. (2) If remanded in custody, the person is to be committed to custody to be brought before the courtÄî (a) at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at such earlier time as the court may require. (3) The court may remand a person on bailÄî (a) by taking from the person a recognizance (with or without sureties) conditioned as provided in paragraph 11, or (b) by fixing the amount of the recognizances with a view to their being taken subsequently in accordance with paragraph 14 and, in the meantime, committing the person to custody as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above. (4) Where a person is brought before the court after remand the court may further remand the person. (5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent. (2) If sub-paragraph (1)(a) applies, the person may be remanded for the period of the adjournment. (3) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody, the person may be committed to the custody of a constable if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days. 13 (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear before the court at the end of the period of remand, the court may further remand the person in his or her absence. (2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge. Other protection or assistance against female genital mutilation 16 (1) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects any other protection or assistance available to a girl who is or may become the victim of a genital mutilation offence. (2) In particular, it does not affectÄî (a) the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court; (b) any criminal liability; (c) any civil remedies under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; (d) any right to an occupation order or a non-molestation order under Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996; (e) any right to a forced marriage protection order under Part 4A of that Act; (f) any protection or assistance under the Children Act 1989; (g) any claim in tort. Interpretation 17 (1) In this Part of this ScheduleÄî Äúthe courtÄù, except as provided in sub-paragraph (2), means the High Court, or the family court, in England and Wales; Äú FGM protection order Äù means an order under paragraph 1; Äú genital mutilation offence Äù means an offence under section 1, 2 or 3; Äú the relevant judge Äù, in relation to an FGM protection order, meansÄî (a) where the order was made by the High Court, a judge of that court; (b) where the order was made by the family court, a judge of that court; (c) where the order was made by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3Äî (i) a judge of that court, or (ii) a judge of the High Court or of the family court. (2) Where the power to make an FGM protection order is exercisable by a court in criminal proceedings under paragraph 3, references in this Part of this Schedule to Äúthe courtÄù (other than in paragraph 2) are to be read as references to that court. (3) In paragraph (c)(i) of the definition of Äúrelevant judgeÄù in sub-paragraph (1), the reference to a judge of the court that made the order includes, in the case of criminal proceedings in a magistrates' court, a reference to a justice of the peace.

F has deliberately and continuously sought to undermine and dismiss Z's expressed wishes and feelings. The reports of his conduct to professionals and in the face of the Court (in respect of where Z should be during the hearing) during the latter part of these proceedings part have provided further evidence of his determination to put himself first. Some of his conduct may well have a basis in his determination to vilify M as a parent but some is a deliberate and direct negation of the maternal side of Z's dual heritage, Z's right to her personal views and opinions and to her right freely to explore both sides of her cultural, religious and social heritage: to undermine Z's ability to do so is an assault on her mental and emotional wellbeing. F's conduct raises further, and serious, concern about the risk to Z of FGM were she to travel to Guinea with F as he now has demonstrated a thorough disregard for what Z herself wants to happen. In pursuing a dismissal of the FGMPO when Z herself wants it to remain in place is of concern in itself, as is the application to take her to Guinea when she is so clearly saying she does not want to go.  The FGMPO will be varied only to the extent that the part giving permission to Z to apply to the Court herself at the age of thirteen is discharged. For the reason set out above the Court has no evidence before it which would justify the discharge of the FGMPO. \n\t  "

(1) Where the court has made an order to which this section applies, then, subject to the provisions of this section and of section 28(1A) above , the court shall have power to vary or discharge the order or to suspend any provision thereof temporarily and to revive the operation of any provision so suspended.

(4) The court shall not exercise the powers conferred by this section in relation to an order for a settlement under section 24(1)(b) or for a variation of settlement under section 24(1)(c) or (d) above except on an application made in proceedings' (a) for the rescission of the judicial separation order by reference to which the order was made, or (b) for the dissolution of the marriage in question. (4A) In relation to an order which falls within paragraph (g) of subsection (2) above ('the subsection (2) order')' (a) the powers conferred by this section may be exercised' (i) only on an application made before the subsection (2) order has or, but for paragraph (b) below, would have taken effect; and (ii) only if, at the time when the application is made, the divorce or nullity of marriage order has not been made final ; and (b) an application made in accordance with paragraph (a) above prevents the subsection (2) order from taking effect before the application has been dealt with. (4B) No variation of a pension sharing order or a pension compensation sharing order, shall be made so as to take effect before the divorce or nullity of marriage order is made final . (4C) The variation of a pension sharing order or a pension compensation sharing order, prevents the order taking effect before the end of such period after the making of the variation as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Lord Chancellor. (5) Subject to subsections (7A) to (7G) below and without prejudice to any power exercisable by virtue of subsection (2)(d), (dd) , (e) or (g) above or otherwise than by virtue of this section, no property adjustment order or pension sharing order or pension compensation sharing order shall be made on an application for the variation of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order made (whether in favour of a party to a marriage or in favour of a child of the family) under section 23 above, and no order for the payment of a lump sum shall be made on an application for the variation of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of a party to a marriage (whether made under section 23 or under section 27 above).

(7) In exercising the powers conferred by this section the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, first consideration being given to the welfare while a minor of any child of the family who has not attained the age of eighteen, and the circumstances of the case shall include any change in any of the matters to which the court was required to have regard when making the order to which the application relates, and' (a) in the case of a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order made on or after the making of a divorce or nullity of marriage order, the court shall consider whether in all the circumstances and after having regard to any such change it would be appropriate to vary the order so that payments under the order are required to be made or secured only for such further period as will in the opinion of the court be sufficient (in the light of any proposed exercise by the court, where the marriage has been dissolved, of its powers under subsection (7B) below) to enable the party in whose favour the order was made to adjust without undue hardship to the termination of those payments; (b) in a case where the party against whom the order was made has died, the circumstances of the case shall also include the changed circumstances resulting from his or her death. (7A) Subsection (7B) below applies where, after the dissolution of a marriage, the court' (a) discharges a periodical payments order or secured periodical payments order made in favour of a party to the marriage; or (b) varies such an order so that payments under the order are required to be made or secured only for such further period as is determined by the court. (7B) The court has power, in addition to any power it has apart from this subsection, to make supplemental provision consisting of any of' (a) an order for the payment of a lump sum in favour of a party to the marriage; (b) one or more property adjustment orders in favour of a party to the marriage; (ba) one or more pension sharing orders; (bb) a pension compensation sharing order; (c) a direction that the party in whose favour the original order discharged or varied was made is not entitled to make any further application for' (i) a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order, or (ii) an extension of the period to which the original order is limited by any variation made by the court. (7C) An order for the payment of a lump sum made under subsection (7B) above may' (a) provide for the payment of that sum by instalments of such amount as may be specified in the order; and (b) require the payment of the instalments to be secured to the satisfaction of the court. (7D) Section 23(6) above applies where the court makes an order for the payment of a lump sum under subsection (7B) above as it applies where the court makes such an order under section 23 above. (7E) If under subsection (7B) above the court makes more than one property adjustment order in favour of the same party to the marriage, each of those orders must fall within a different paragraph of section 21(2) above. (7F) Sections 24A and 30 above apply where the court makes a property adjustment order under subsection (7B) above as they apply where it makes such an order under section 24 above. (7G) Subsections (3) to (5) of section 24B above apply in relation to a pension sharing order under subsection (7B) above as they apply in relation to a pension sharing order under that section. (7H) Subsections (3) to (10) of section 24E above apply in relation to a pension compensation sharing order under subsection (7B) above as they apply in relation to a pension compensation sharing order under that section. (8) The personal representatives of a deceased person against whom a secured periodical payments order was made shall not be liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the expiration of the period of six months referred to in subsection (6) above on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might permit an application under this section to be made after that period by the person entitled to payments under the order; but this subsection shall not prejudice any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order in pursuance of this section. (9) The following are to be left out of account when considering for the purposes of subsection (6) above when representation was first taken out' (a) a grant limited to settled land or to trust property, (b) any other grant that does not permit any of the estate to be distributed, (c) a grant limited to real estate or to personal estate, unless a grant limited to the remainder of the estate has previously been made or is made at the same time, (d) a grant, or its equivalent, made outside the United Kingdom (but see subsection (9A) below). (9A) A grant sealed under section 2 of the Colonial Probates Act 1892 counts as a grant made in the United Kingdom for the purposes of subsection (9) above, but is to be taken as dated on the date of sealing. (10) Where the court, in exercise of its powers under this section, decides to vary or discharge a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order, then, subject to section 28(1) and (2) above, the court shall have power to direct that the variation or discharge shall not take effect until the expiration of such period as may be specified in the order. (11) Where' (a) a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of more than one child ('the order') is in force; (b) the order requires payments specified in it to be made to or for the benefit of more than one child without apportioning those payments between them; (c) a maintenance calculation (' the calculation ') is made with respect to one or more, but not all, of the children with respect to whom those payments are to be made; and (d) an application is made, before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which the calculation was made, for the variation or discharge of the order, the court may, in exercise of its powers under this section to vary or discharge the order, direct that the variation or discharge shall take effect from the date on which the calculation took effect or any later date. (12) Where' (a) an order ('the child order') of a kind prescribed for the purposes of section 10(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 is affected by a maintenance calculation ; (b) on the date on which the child order became so affected there was in force a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order ('the spousal order') in favour of a party to a marriage having the care of the child in whose favour the child order was made; and (c) an application is made, before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which the maintenance calculation was made, for the spousal order to be varied or discharged, the court may, in exercise of its powers under this section to vary or discharge the spousal order, direct that the variation or discharge shall take effect from the date on which the child order became so affected or any later date. (13) For the purposes of subsection (12) above, an order is affected if it ceases to have effect or is modified by or under section 10 of the Child Support Act 1991. (14) Subsections (11) and (12) above are without prejudice to any other power of the court to direct that the variation of discharge of an order under this section shall take effect from a date earlier than that on which the order for variation or discharge was made. (15) The power to make regulations under subsection (4C) above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. (16) See also section 52A (interpretation of certain references to divorce orders, nullity of marriage orders and judicial separation orders)." ] ,

She has a litigation loan with a figure outstanding of (ï¿½ï¿½576,903). I am clear that the Husband must discharge this loan. The current costs regime in force in relation to financial remedy proceedings is that there is a presumption of no order as to costs. The court proceeds on the basis that litigation liabilities should be cleared before considering the needs of the parties. I have already made the point that many husbands would have offered to discharge the Wife's costs liability. I cannot permit this Wife to be in a worse situation than if the Husband had agreed to do so. Equally, I cannot decide any costs application in advance. The Husband must discharge her costs liability over and above making provision for her in accordance with the PNA in the sum of ï¿½ï¿½11.75 million. There can then be a costs argument, if necessary, at a later stage. If the Husband satisfies me that she should pay part or all of his costs, so be it but I am not prepared to decide that argument in advance, let alone make her pay her costs out of her provision of ï¿½ï¿½11.75 million, which was meant for her housing and income needs."

(2) The 'quality condition' is met if the quality of evidence given by the witness on cross-examination' (a) is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) is conducted by the party in person, and (b) would be likely to be improved if a direction were given under this section. (3) The 'significant distress condition' is met if' (a) the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) of the witness by the party in person would be likely to cause significant distress to the witness or the party, and (b) that distress is likely to be more significant than would be the case if the witness were cross-examined other than by the party in person. (4) A direction under this section may be made by the court' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the party in relation to the witness; (e) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the witness in relation to the party; (f) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (g) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (h) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (i) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (j) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party. (6) In subsection (5)(d) and (e) ' specified offence ' means an offence that is a specified offence for the purposes of section 85F. (7) Any reference in this section to the quality of a witness's evidence is to its quality in terms of completeness, coherence and accuracy.

(2) But the court may revoke a direction under section 85I before the witness is discharged, if it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so, either' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (3) The court may revoke a direction under section 85I on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since' (a) the direction was given, or (b) if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. (4) The court must state its reasons for' (a) giving a direction under section 85I; (b) refusing an application for a direction under section 85I; (c) revoking a direction under section 85I; (d) refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 85I. 85K Alternatives to cross-examination in person (1) This section applies where a party to civil proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 85F to 85I. (2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. (5) The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. (6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party. (7) A qualified legal representative appointed by the court under subsection (6) is not responsible to the party. (8) For the purposes of this section' (a) a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; (b) ' qualified legal representative ' means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in civil proceedings. 85L Costs of legal representatives appointed under section 85K(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision for the payment out of central funds of sums in respect of' (a) fees or costs properly incurred by a qualified legal representative appointed under section 85K(6), and (b) expenses properly incurred in providing such a person with evidence or other material in connection with the appointment.

They are that i) The judge must decide what is in the best interests of the child. ii) In making that decision the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. iii) The judge must look at the question from the assumed point of view of the child. iv) There is a strong presumption in favour of a course of action that will be likely to preserve life, but that presumption is not irrebuttable. v) The term \" best interests \" encompasses medical, emotional and all other welfare issues. vi) The court must consider the views of the doctors and parents. vii) Each case will turn on its own facts. viii) The court must conduct a balancing exercise in which all relevant factors are weighed. This is not a mathematical exercise, but it is an objective one. It is important that Kwame's family understand that  each case will turn on its own facts   means that when a decision is to be made about Kwame it is a decision about him; what had happened to him; his particular circumstances and that just because other families have found themselves in similar terrible situations does not mean that there is a 'one size fits all' answer.

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 33 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   In this case I drew great assistance from two decisions. They shape and inform how a court should approach the question of the summary return order under the inherent jurisdiction.  \n\t   Re  J (Custody Right: Jurisdiction)  [2005] UKHL 40 and, as I have indicated:  In the matter of NY (A Child)   [2019] UKSC 49 . Overall, the law that governs this question is well established. It can be distilled into the following eight principles. I will detail each of them, before I return to  Re J  and  NY,  in a little more detail. \n\t     \n\t   (i) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     Paramountcy . I want to make it clear that the paramountcy principle informs everything that this court does in respect of this application. The welfare of L and Q is the court's paramount consideration, which means nothing supplants it. \n\t     \n\t   (ii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The test . The test is the best welfare interests of the child. \n\t     \n\t   (iii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t     The focus of the welfare question . The issue is not to do with the range of options about who the children should live with, or the levels of contact or long term arrangements for them. It is much more tightly focused. It is simply this: is summary return in the best welfare interests of the child. But this issue can be further refined with a codicil to the issue that the summary return is because the court in the receiving jurisdiction is best placed to make decisions about the best arrangements for the child's short-term, medium-term and long-term future ( In the matter of   KL  in the Supreme Court). To answer that question there must necessarily be a welfare analysis.  \n\t     \n\t   (iv) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The finding of wrongful retention does not mean that there must be automatic return. There must be a welfare evaluation to decide whether the return is in the welfare interests of the child. I will come to the intensity of that welfare scrutiny shortly.  \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (v) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The application here, under the inherent jurisdiction, is a route to determining the issue of summary return. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   (vi) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whether the welfare analysis were under a specific issue order for the purposes of  \n\t     section 8  of the  Children Act 1989  or the inherent jurisdiction the principles are the same.  \n\t     \n\t   (vii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   The function of the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction is to promote and safeguard the welfare of the children. This is clear from the historical origins of the inherent jurisdiction as I have demonstrated. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t (viii) \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Whilst  \n\t     In the matter of NY  involved the court considering an outward return order, Mostyn J in  Re N   [2020] EWFC 35  concluded that the principles set out in  NY  apply equally to applications for an inward return order, as is sought by Mr PT here.

(1) When a court determines any question with respect toÄî (a) the upbringing of a child; or (b) the administration of a childÄôs property or the application of any income arising from it, the childÄôs welfare shall be the courtÄôs paramount consideration. (2) In any proceedings in which any question with respect to the upbringing of a child arises, the court shall have regard to the general principle that any delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child. (2A) A court, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (4)(a) or (7), is as respects each parent within subsection (6)(a) to presume, unless the contrary is shown, that involvement of that parent in the life of the child concerned will further the child's welfare. (2B) In subsection (2A) Äú involvement Äù means involvement of some kind, either direct or indirect, but not any particular division of a child's time. (3) In the circumstances mentioned in subsection (4), a court shall have regard in particular toÄî (a) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding); (b) his physical, emotional and educational needs; (c) the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances; (d) his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant; (e) any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering; (f) how capable each of his parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs; (g) the range of powers available to the court under this Act in the proceedings in question.

(5) Where a court is considering whether or not to make one or more orders under this Act with respect to a child, it shall not make the order or any of the orders unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all. (6) In subsection (2A) Äú parent Äù means parent of the child concerned; and, for the purposes of that subsection, a parent of the child concernedÄî (a) is within this paragraph if that parent can be involved in the child's life in a way that does not put the child at risk of suffering harm; and (b) is to be treated as being within paragraph (a) unless there is some evidence before the court in the particular proceedings to suggest that involvement of that parent in the child's life would put the child at risk of suffering harm whatever the form of the involvement. (7) The circumstances referred to are that the court is considering whether to make an order under section 4(1)(c) or (2A) or 4ZA(1)(c) or (5) (parental responsibility of parent other than mother)." ] ,

          "paragraph_text" : "\n\t   \n\t 17 \n\t   \n\t     \n\t   In those circumstances, it is appropriate for me to consider the substantive application for summary return.  Iran is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and this application is made under the court's inherent jurisdiction.  I have been referred to  \n\t   Re J (A Child)   [2005] UKHL 40 , in which Lady Hale of Richmond set out the following propositions.  She said: \n\t     \n\t   '24. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   This House, in the leading case of  \n\t     J v C  [170] AC 668, regarded it as clearly decided by  Re B's Settlement  and  McKee v McKee  that the existence of a foreign order would not oust the jurisdiction or preclude the operation of the welfare principle.  This applies  a fortiori  where the foreign court would have had jurisdiction to make an order but has not done so, so that no question of comity arises ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   25. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Hence, in all non-Convention cases, the courts have consistently held that they must act in accordance with the welfare of the individual child.  If they do decide to return the child, that is because it is in his best interests to do so, not because the welfare principle has been superseded by some other consideration.  This was so, even in those cases decided around the time that the Hague Convention was being implemented here, where it was held that the courts should take account of its philosophyï¿½Ä¶  The Court of Appeal, in  \n\t     Re P (A Minor) (Child Abduction: Non Convention County)   [1997] Fam 45  has held that the Hague Convention concepts are not to be applied in a non-Convention case.  Hence, the first two propositions set out by Mr Justice Hughes in the case were entirely correct: the child's welfare is paramount and the specialist rules and concepts of the Hague Convention are not to be applied by analogy in a non-Convention case. \n\t     \n\t   26. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Thirdly, however, the court does have power, in accordance with the welfare principle, to order the immediate return of a child to a foreign jurisdiction without conducting a full investigation of the merits.  In a series of cases during the 1960s, these came to be known as 'kidnapping' cases.  The principles were summed up by Lord Justice Buckley in  \n\t     Re L (Minors) (Wardship: Jurisdiction)   [1974] 1 WLR 250 , at p.264, rightly described by Lord Justice Ward in  Re P  and  Reï¿½ï¿½JA  as the  locus classicus: \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     'To take a child from his native land, to remove him to another country where, maybe, his native tongue is not spoken, to divorce him from the social customs and contacts to which he has been accustomed, to interrupt his education in his native land and subject him to a foreign system of education, are all acts (offered here as examples and of course not as a complete catalogue of possible relevant factors) which are likely to be psychologically disturbing to the child, particularly at a time when his family life is also disrupted. If such a case is promptly brought to the attention of a court in this country, the judge may feel that it is in the best interests of the infant that these disturbing factors should be eliminated from his life as speedily as possible.  A full investigation of the merits of the case in an English court may be incompatible with achieving this.  The judge may well be persuaded that it would be better for the child that those merits should be investigated in a court in his native country.' \n\t       \n\t     \n\t   27. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     He went on to emphasise that in doing so, the court was not punishing the parent for her conduct, but applying the cardinal rule. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t     \n\t   28. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     It is plain, therefore, that there is always a choice to be made.  Summary return should not be the automatic reaction to any and every unauthorised taking or keeping of a child from his home country.  On the other hand, summary return may very well be in the best interests of the individual child. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     \n\t       Making the choice \n\t     \n\t   29. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     How then is the trial judge to set about making that choice?  His focus has to be on the individual child in the particular circumstances of the case.  The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  The policy considerations which have led this country to enter into international treaties for the good of children in general are irrelevant.  A fortiori, the hope that countries which have not yet become parties to such treaties might be encouraged to do so in future is irrelevant.  There may be good reasons why those countries are unable to join the club.  They may well believe that it would be contrary to the fundamental principles of their laws to accept the reciprocity entailed. \n\t      As my noble and learned friend, Lord Hoffmann, pointed out in the course of the argument, they may have no incentive to join if their children are returned to them without their having to return other children to a system which is so completely different from their own.  This is all pure speculation and has nothing to do with the welfare of the little boy whose future has to be decided in this case. \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t       \n\t     \n\t   32. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   ï¿½Ä¶the judge may find it convenient to start from the proposition that it is likely to be better for a child to return to his home country for any disputes about his future to be decided there.  A case against his doing so has to be made.  But the weight to be given to that proposition will vary enormously from case to case.  What may be best for him in the long run may be different from what will be best for him in the short run.  It should not be assumed, in this or any other case, that allowing a child to remain here while his future is decided here inevitably means that he will remain here for ever. \n\t     \n\t     \n\t   33. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   One important variable, as indicated in  \n\t     Re L , is the degree of connection of the child with each country.  This is not to apply what has become the technical concept of habitual residence, but to ask in a common sense way with which country the child has the closer connection.  What is his 'home' country?  Factors such as his nationality, where he has lived for most of his life, his first language, his race or ethnicity, his religion, his culture, and his education so far will all come into this. \n\t     \n\t   34. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t     Another closely related factor will be the length of time he has spent in each country.  Uprooting a child from one environment and bringing him to a completely unfamiliar one, especially if this has been done clandestinely, may well not be in his best interests.  A child may be deeply unhappy about being recruited to one side in a parental battle.  But if he is already familiar with this country, has been here for some time without objection, it may be less disruptive for him to remain a little while longer while his medium and longer term future is decided than it would be to return. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   \n\t\t \n\t     ï¿½Ä¶ \n\t       \n\t     \n\t 38. \n\t     \n\t       \n\t   Hence, our law does not start from any  \n\t     a priori  assumptions about what is best for any individual child.  It looks at the child and weighs a number of factors in the balance, now set out in the well-known 'check-list' in  section 1(3)  of the  Children Act 1989 ; these include his own wishes and feelings, his physical, emotional and educational needs and the relative capacities of the adults around him to meet those needs, the effect of change, his own characteristics and background, including his ethnicity, culture and religion, and any harm he has suffered or risks suffering in the future.  There is nothing in those principles which prevents a court from giving great weight to the culture in which a child has been brought up when deciding how and where he will fare best in the future.  Our own society is a multi-cultural one, but looking at it from the child's point of view, as we all try to do, it may sometimes be necessary to resolve or diffuse a clash between the different cultures within his own family.'"

(2) In deciding whether to exercise its powers under sub-paragraph (1), the court must have regard to all the circumstances includingÄî (a) the risk to the girl, or to another person, of becoming a victim of a genital mutilation offence if the order is not made immediately, (b) whether it is likely that an applicant will be deterred or prevented from pursuing an application if an order is not made immediately, and (c) whether there is reason to believe thatÄî (i) the respondent is aware of the proceedings but is deliberately evading service, and (ii) the delay involved in effecting substituted service will cause serious prejudice to the girl to be protected or (if different) an applicant. (3) The court must give the respondent an opportunity to make representations about an order made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1). (4) The opportunity must beÄî (a) as soon as just and convenient, and (b) at a hearing of which notice has been given to all the parties in accordance with rules of court.

(5) The relevant judge has the same power to make an order under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (remand for report on accused's mental condition) as the Crown Court has under section 35 of that Act in the case of an accused person within the meaning of that section. Remand: further provision 10 (1) Where a court has power to remand a person under paragraph 8, the court may remand the person in custody or on bail. (2) If remanded in custody, the person is to be committed to custody to be brought before the courtÄî (a) at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at such earlier time as the court may require. (3) The court may remand a person on bailÄî (a) by taking from the person a recognizance (with or without sureties) conditioned as provided in paragraph 11, or (b) by fixing the amount of the recognizances with a view to their being taken subsequently in accordance with paragraph 14 and, in the meantime, committing the person to custody as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above. (4) Where a person is brought before the court after remand the court may further remand the person. (5) In this paragraph and in paragraphs 11 to 14, references to Äú the court Äù includes a reference to a judge of the court or, in the case of proceedings in a magistrates' court, a justice of the peace. 11 (1) Where a person is remanded on bail, the court may direct that the person's recognizance be conditioned for his or her appearanceÄî (a) before the court at the end of the period of remand, or (b) at every time and place to which during the course of the proceedings the hearing may from time to time be adjourned. (2) Where a recognizance is conditioned for a person's appearance as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the fixing of any time for the person next to appear is to be treated as a remand. (3) Nothing in this paragraph deprives the court of power at any subsequent hearing to remand a person afresh. 12 (1) The court may not remand a person for a period exceeding 8 clear days unlessÄî (a) the court adjourns a case under paragraph 9(1), or (b) the person is remanded on bail and both that person and the other party to the proceedings (or, in the case of criminal proceedings, the prosecution) consent.

(3) Where the court has power to remand a person in custody, the person may be committed to the custody of a constable if the remand is for a period not exceeding 3 clear days. 13 (1) If the court is satisfied that a person who has been remanded is unable by reason of illness or accident to appear before the court at the end of the period of remand, the court may further remand the person in his or her absence. (2) The power in sub-paragraph (1) may, in the case of a person who was remanded on bail, be exercised by enlarging the person's recognizance and those of any sureties to a later time. (3) Where a person remanded on bail is bound to appear before the court at any time and the court has no power to remand the person under sub-paragraph (1), the court may, in the person's absence, enlarge the person's recognizance and those of any sureties for the person to a later time. (4) The enlargement of a person's recognizance is to be treated as a further remand. (5) Paragraph 12(1) (limit of remand) does not apply to the exercise of the powers conferred by this paragraph. 14 (1) This paragraph applies where under paragraph 10(3)(b) the court fixes the amount in which the principal and the sureties (if any) are to be bound. (2) The recognizance may afterwards be taken by a person prescribed by rules of court (with the same consequences as if it had been entered into before the court). Contempt proceedings 15 The powers of the court in relation to contempt of court arising out of a person's failure to comply with an FGM protection order, or otherwise in connection with such an order, may be exercised by the relevant judge.

In  [1999] 1 FLR 1145 ; Re C (Abduction: Grave Risk of Physical and Psychological Harm)  [1999] 2 FLR 478 ; Re T (Abduction: Child's Objection to Return)  [2000] 2 FLR 192 ; Re H (Abduction)  [2009] EWHC 1735 (Fam) ,  [2009] 2 FLR 1513 ; WF v FJ and Others  [2010] EWHC 2909 (Fam) ,  [2011] 1 FLR 1153 Re S (Habitual Residence and ChildÄôs Objections: Brazil)  the Court of Appeal upheld an [2015] EWCA Civ 2 order, based on child objections, which had the effect of separating a 12year-old (who objected to a return to Brazil after a holiday here) from a 10-year-old sibling. And I note that The Guide to Good Practice Under the Hague Convention 1980 indicates that separation of siblings, while difficult and disruptive, Äúdoes not usually result in a grave risk of harm determination and the courts have been willing to make orders having that effect. Further, a separation is not necessarily or inevitably permanent as the state of habitual residence will consider all welfare issuesÄù. "

(2) The 'quality condition' is met if the quality of evidence given by the witness on cross-examination' (a) is likely to be diminished if the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) is conducted by the party in person, and (b) would be likely to be improved if a direction were given under this section. (3) The 'significant distress condition' is met if' (a) the cross-examination (or continued cross-examination) of the witness by the party in person would be likely to cause significant distress to the witness or the party, and (b) that distress is likely to be more significant than would be the case if the witness were cross-examined other than by the party in person. (4) A direction under this section may be made by the court' (a) on an application made by a party to the proceedings, or (b) of its own motion. (5) In determining whether the quality condition or the significant distress condition is met in the case of a witness or party, the court must have regard to, among other things' (a) any views expressed by the witness as to whether or not the witness is content to be cross-examined by the party in person; (b) any views expressed by the party as to whether or not the party is content to cross-examine the witness in person; (c) the nature of the questions likely to be asked, having regard to the issues in the proceedings; (d) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the party in relation to the witness; (e) any charge of which the court is aware in respect of a specified offence alleged to have been committed by the witness in relation to the party; (f) any behaviour by the party in relation to the witness in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (g) any behaviour by the witness in relation to the party in respect of which the court is aware that a finding of fact has been made in the proceedings or in any other proceedings; (h) any behaviour by the party at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the witness; (i) any behaviour by the witness at any stage of the proceedings, both generally and in relation to the party; (j) any relationship (of whatever nature) between the witness and the party. (6) In subsection (5)(d) and (e) ' specified offence ' means an offence that is a specified offence for the purposes of section 85F.

(3) The court may revoke a direction under section 85I on an application made by a party to the proceedings only if there has been a material change of circumstances since' (a) the direction was given, or (b) if a previous application has been made by a party to the proceedings, the application (or the last application) was determined. (4) The court must state its reasons for' (a) giving a direction under section 85I; (b) refusing an application for a direction under section 85I; (c) revoking a direction under section 85I; (d) refusing an application for the revocation of a direction under section 85I. 85K Alternatives to cross-examination in person (1) This section applies where a party to civil proceedings is prevented from cross-examining a witness in person by virtue of any of sections 85F to 85I. (2) The court must consider whether (ignoring this section) there is a satisfactory alternative means' (a) for the witness to be cross-examined in the proceedings, or (b) of obtaining evidence that the witness might have given under cross-examination in the proceedings. (3) If the court decides that there is not, the court must' (a) invite the party to the proceedings to arrange for a qualified legal representative to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, and (b) require the party to the proceedings to notify the court, by the end of a period specified by the court, of whether a qualified legal representative is to act for the party for that purpose. (4) Subsection (5) applies if, by the end of the period specified under subsection (3)(b), either' (a) the party has notified the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness, or (b) no notification has been received by the court and it appears to the court that no qualified legal representative is to act for the party for the purpose of cross-examining the witness. (5) The court must consider whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by a qualified legal representative appointed by the court to represent the interests of the party. (6) If the court decides that it is, the court must appoint a qualified legal representative (chosen by the court) to cross-examine the witness in the interests of the party. (7) A qualified legal representative appointed by the court under subsection (6) is not responsible to the party. (8) For the purposes of this section' (a) a reference to cross-examination includes a reference to continuing to conduct cross-examination; (b) ' qualified legal representative ' means a person who, for the purposes of the Legal Services Act 2007, is an authorised person in relation to an activity which constitutes the exercise of a right of audience (within the meaning of that Act) in civil proceedings. 85L Costs of legal representatives appointed under section 85K(6) (1) The Lord Chancellor may by regulations make provision for the payment out of central funds of sums in respect of' (a) fees or costs properly incurred by a qualified legal representative appointed under section 85K(6), and (b) expenses properly incurred in providing such a person with evidence or other material in connection with the appointment.

(3) The Lord Chancellor may from time to time revise any guidance issued under this section. (4) The Lord Chancellor must publish' (a) any guidance issued under this section, and (b) any revisions of that guidance. 85N Regulations under Part 7A Regulations under this Part may make different provision for different purposes." ] ,
