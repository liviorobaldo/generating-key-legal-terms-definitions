I will provide you with:

- A key legal term that occurs in UK legislation.
- The URL of the UK act from which the term is taken.
- One or more paragraphs from UK case law in which the term is judicially interpreted.
Instructions:
- Step-by-step reasoning (Chain-of-Thought): First, reason step by step about how the case-law paragraphs
interpret the term, highlighting key legal aspects and connections to the legislation.
- Generate definition: Based on your reasoning, produce a concise, domain-neutral definition suitable
for inclusion in UK legislation.
- Reference legislation if helpful: You may refer to the verbatim text of the relevant statutory sections,
but the final definition must primarily reflect the judicial interpretation.

Note:
- Do not include background facts of the case-law paragraphs in the final definition.
- Use standard legal phrasing from UK Acts, such as “<legal-term> is...” or “<legal-term> means...”.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Relevance to paragraph context
- Quality and specificity of legal terms
- Clear connection between case law and legislation
- Avoid redundant or duplicate content
- Faithfulness to judicial interpretation
- Clarity and conciseness of reasoning
- Production of only the required JSON object, with no additional commentary
- Legislative tone in the “definition”, without factual background or narrative
- Focused, stepwise “reasoning” directly tied to the legal interpretation

Response Format: Return only a valid JSON object with the following fields (and nothing else):
{
"key_legal_term": "<term>",
"definition": "<concise, domain-neutral definition>",
"reasoning": "<step-by-step analysis linking case law and legislation>",
"confidence": "High/Medium/Low"
}

Field specifications:
- “key legal term”: the original legal term being defined.
- “definition”: a concise, domain-neutral formulation suitable for inclusion in UK legislation.
- “reasoning”: the chain-of-thought analysis showing how the paragraphs were used in the definition.
- “confidence”: an indication of how confident you are that the definition accurately reflects the judicial interpretation (High, Medium, Low).
