	"definition" : "'Controlling or coercive behaviour' means a sustained pattern of acts or omissions by a person towards another that are designed to dominate, control, or coerce the victim, causing or creating a significant risk of serious physical, psychological, emotional, or financial harm. Such behaviour may include isolating the victim, restricting their freedom, manipulating or influencing their decisions, exploiting their vulnerabilities, or perpetrating financial abuse, and its effects may extend to children or other members of the household even in the absence of physical violence or sexual abuse." ,
	"reasoning" : "The case-law materials collectively stress that the term concerns a pattern rather than isolated incidents, with courts warning that focusing on individual episodes may obscure the cumulative harm. The paragraphs describe recurring mechanisms: influence that overrides the victim's autonomy; exploitation of vulnerability (including pregnancy, emotional dependence, or lack of resources); acts restricting mobility, communication, or access to support; financial manipulation or fraud compelled through pressure; and conduct that creates fear, anxiety, or an atmosphere of domination. They also confirm that serious harm may arise even without physical violence, and that coercive or controlling behaviour includes psychological, emotional, and financial dimensions. Synthesising these judicial themes supports a definition centred on sustained domination, compulsion, and the erosion of the victim's independence and safety across multiple forms of conduct.",

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph demonstrates that practice directions operate as procedural mechanisms that work alongside court rules to ensure fair trials and proper participation in proceedings. The court refers to 'the relevant Rule and Practice Direction' as distinct but complementary instruments, showing that practice directions supplement formal rules. The judicial interpretation emphasizes that practice directions serve to protect fundamental procedural rights, particularly ensuring fair participation for vulnerable parties and compliance with Article 6 ECHR requirements. The court treats practice directions as authoritative guidance that, when appropriately applied, helps prevent breaches of natural justice, indicating their role as procedural safeguards that supplement the formal rule framework." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that having a mental disorder alone does not determine lack of mental capacity under sections 2 and 3 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The court emphasises that conditions such as anxiety or depression constitute mental disorders but are insufficient by themselves to establish incapacity. This interpretation requires that any condition or behavioural aspect must be assessed in relation to the person's actual decision-making ability for the specific matter at hand, rather than being treated as determinative of capacity. The reasoning demonstrates that the statutory phrase encompasses mental disorders and behavioural manifestations while requiring additional evidence of functional impairment in decision-making capacity." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that 'best interests' requires an objective assessment rather than subjective preferences. The court emphasizes a crucial distinction between parental views about the child's best interests (which must be respected and considered) and the parents' independent wishes (which should not be determinative). The analysis shows that while views of those close to the person must be taken into account under human rights obligations, particularly when the person cannot express their own wishes, these views require proper scrutiny and cannot override the objective welfare assessment. The court's emphasis on avoiding confusion between objective best interests and satisfaction of others' wishes indicates that best interests analysis must maintain independence from external preferences, even when such preferences are understandable and genuine." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph demonstrates judicial interpretation of parental abduction through the specific example in Re KR, where a teenage girl was 'lured to India to be forcibly married'. The court's response of deploying parens patriae jurisdiction to 'find her, rescue her and repatriate her' establishes that abduction encompasses not just physical force but also deceptive means ('lured'). The judicial creativity mentioned shows courts have expanded the concept beyond simple physical taking to include situations where parents remove children to different jurisdictions for harmful purposes. The reference to 'forcible removal by parents' in the case title, combined with the court's protective response and ordering of repatriation, indicates that abduction involves wrongful taking that necessitates judicial intervention to restore the child to safety. The linking of this case with other protective jurisdiction cases (forced marriage, FGM) confirms the interpretation focuses on child welfare and prevention of harm." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation emphasizes that local authorities must conduct thorough inquiries into relatives' circumstances rather than making summary exclusions. The court found that even where concerns exist about relatives, these must be of sufficient gravity to justify exclusion, and relatives should be permitted to advance cases about meaningful contributions to the child's life. The interpretation extends beyond primary care to include other roles such as contact relationships that may benefit the child's development. The court specifically noted that relationship difficulties between family members should not lead to automatic exclusion where positive indicators exist, demonstrating that both current capacity and willingness must be properly evaluated through comprehensive assessment rather than preliminary judgments." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law demonstrates that parties can hold property as joint tenants in law and equity with express declarations of trust, creating undivided interests in multiple properties. The court's treatment of the joint tenancies shows that each party had defined fractional entitlements (half shares in this case) without physical division of the properties. The judicial approach of calculating specific monetary amounts owed to each party (£1,909,375 each after equitable accounting) reflects the absolute nature of their entitlement to their respective shares. The court's ability to order equitable accounting and lump sum payments to ensure equal distribution demonstrates that the parties' rights were complete and enforceable, but related to fractional interests in the undivided properties rather than rights to specific physical portions." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph discusses domestic abuse in the context of potential harm, specifically referencing both physical and psychological harm that can result from abusive behaviour. The court recognizes that domestic abuse can create situations involving 'physical or psychological harm' and places individuals in 'intolerable situation[s]'. The judicial interpretation demonstrates that abusive behaviour encompasses conduct that produces harmful effects on the victim's wellbeing, whether through direct physical impact or psychological consequences. The court's analysis shows that the concept of abuse is understood to involve behaviour that creates risk of harm and adverse psychological effects. While the case involves family proceedings, the underlying judicial understanding of what constitutes abuse - behaviour causing physical or psychological harm - provides the foundational interpretation for the statutory term." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes three key requirements for accommodation in care facilities: (1) the necessity for proper registration of the care facility before accommodation can be provided, indicating that 'accommodation' is tied to formal regulatory compliance; (2) the requirement that the service provider must confirm their capability to meet the specific needs of the person being accommodated, showing that 'accommodation' encompasses both physical placement and appropriate care provision; and (3) the ongoing responsibility of local authorities to ensure safety and suitability of premises, staff, and care standards, demonstrating that 'accommodation' includes continuous oversight and quality assurance.

This suggests that 'account of his dealings' requires comprehensive disclosure of financial affairs. The judicial interpretation emphasizes that the account must be 'proper' - indicating a standard of thoroughness and accuracy. The reference to adverse inferences for inadequate disclosure shows that the account must be substantive enough to satisfy judicial scrutiny. The term 'dealings' encompasses not just transactions but the broader management and handling of assets or property.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that acquisition of parental responsibility is tied to statutory mechanisms under the Children Act 1989, particularly section 4(1). The court clarifies that for unmarried fathers, registration on the birth certificate constitutes a route to acquiring parental responsibility, but this is conditional on the individual being 'in fact and in law' the father. The judgment emphasises that section 4 does not apply to individuals who are not the legal father, meaning factual and legal paternity is a prerequisite for acquisition. The court's analysis demonstrates that acquisition is not automatic from registration alone but depends on the underlying legal relationship of parentage being established." ,

The court refers to 'divorce litigation' and 'Russian proceedings' that need to reach a 'forensic conclusion', indicating that the term includes the entire litigation process. The judge's analysis shows that divorce proceedings involve examining parties' 'adjusted financial resources' and require procedural steps to achieve finality. The reference to 'well-advanced divorce litigation' demonstrates that the action continues through various stages until complete resolution.

The court emphasizes that adequate assessment requires 'proper and thorough evaluation' of relevant factors, indicating that adequacy is measured by sufficiency for comprehensive analysis. The court considers multiple evidence sources and factors (school identification, administrative region, state protection levels, individual circumstances) to reach a balanced conclusion, showing that adequate information must enable informed decision-making.

The judicial interpretation recognizes that intoxication can occur through various means - either by direct administration by another person or through circumstances that cause a person to consume intoxicating substances. The court's analysis suggests that the legal concern is not limited to forcible administration but extends to any situation where substances are caused to be taken, regardless of the specific mechanism. This interpretation supports a broad understanding of how intoxicating substances can be introduced, encompassing both active administration by a perpetrator and situations where the perpetrator causes or facilitates the victim's consumption of such substances.

The paragraph focuses on medical treatment decisions and parental responsibility regarding consent for medical procedures, specifically discussing 'serious medical treatment' and 'general anaesthetic.' While it mentions the exercise of parental responsibility, it does not address property administration. The judicial interpretation relates to medical decision-making rather than financial or property management aspects that would typically fall under 'administration of a child's property.'

The court emphasizes that this term operates within a framework of statutory consent provisions under Part IV of the Mental Health Act 1983. The interpretation clarifies that administration can occur without patient consent in specified circumstances (up to three months under s.63), but requires additional safeguards for longer periods or specified medications under s.58(3).

The Court of Appeal in Hollington v Hewthorn ruled that evidence of a conviction was 'inadmissible' in subsequent civil proceedings, establishing that admissibility depends on whether evidence can be 'received' by a court as proof of facts. The judgment creates a negative definition by showing that certain evidence (previous judgments) cannot be used to prove the underlying facts in new proceedings. This indicates that admissibility is fundamentally about a court's capacity to accept and consider evidence as probative material, governed by evidential rules that determine what may or may not be received as proof." ,

The paragraph further clarifies that while courts may draw logical inferences, these must be based on evidence that has been accepted, demonstrating that the admission process involves judicial evaluation and acceptance of evidence as reliable.

The court emphasises that adoption involves 'the recognition of a child's parentage', indicating it creates or confirms legal parent-child relationships.

The court recognised that Indian guardianship orders, though not technically adoptions, created 'a situation corresponding to family life between the parents and each child akin to a permanent legal relationship' and conferred 'rights analogous to birth parents'. The interpretation emphasises that the substance of the relationship matters: where there is a 'permanent legal status' that 'echoes, in every sense, the adoption of these children' and creates 'de facto family ties', the child should be treated as adopted.

The phrase 'to apply' in this context refers to the conditions under which foreign orders will be given recognition and effect.

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph discusses the assessment of relationships and significance of relatives in decision-making contexts, emphasizing that relatives can be 'close' or 'distant' within extended family networks. While the paragraph does not explicitly define 'adoptive relative', it establishes the legal principle that relatives' significance varies based on the substance and closeness of their relationship. The judicial interpretation suggests that relatives encompass both immediate and extended family members, and their legal standing depends on the degree of connection. Applied to the adoptive context, this indicates that an adoptive relative would be someone whose family relationship derives from adoption rather than birth, but whose significance is measured by the same relational criteria. The court's emphasis on assessing 'the significance of relatives' and distinguishing between 'close' and 'distant' family members provides the interpretive framework for understanding how adoptive relationships create legally recognized family connections." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that adoptive relationships create genuine family connections equivalent to biological ones. The court recognized that adoptive siblings (TN and RN) who lived together in the same home were 'treated as siblings' by their adoptive family and 'shared the routines of daily family life.' The judge emphasized that the adoptive nature of the sibling relationship did not diminish its legal significance, stating 'I do not consider that the fact that the children are adoptive siblings alters my conclusion' regarding their family life status. The interpretation focuses on the practical reality of family relationships created through adoption rather than biological connection, with the court finding 'de facto family life' based on 'close personal ties' developed through shared living arrangements and family treatment. This establishes that adoptive relatives are those connected through legal adoption processes who develop genuine familial bonds through cohabitation and mutual care within a family unit." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph establishes a balancing test for determining when an adverse effect occurs. The court identifies that injury or harm must be assessed against benefit, specifically requiring that 'the injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure...must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.' This creates a comparative standard where adverse effect is measured by whether detriment exceeds advantage. The phrase 'correct disposal of litigation' indicates the court's focus on proper resolution of proceedings. The judicial interpretation thus frames adverse effect as requiring a balancing exercise between harm and benefit, with adverse effect occurring when harm predominates over the interests of just case resolution." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph demonstrates judicial recognition that there are distinct legal regimes and protections that apply differently based on age thresholds. The cases involving children aged 14 and 15 show these children were still subject to particular legal frameworks (Hague Convention proceedings) that treat them as requiring specific protections. This judicial approach indicates that 'age of sixteen' represents a legal boundary - children below this age remain subject to certain protective legal regimes, while those at or above this threshold are treated differently under the law. The court's consideration of objections from children under sixteen within specialized legal frameworks suggests that sixteen represents a significant legal transition point in how children's autonomy and legal status are treated." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation shows that 'age or appearance' operates as interconnected factors in legal assessment. The court emphasizes that age must be given 'appropriate weight' when considering a person's likely attitude, specifically noting how different ages correlate with different values and perspectives. The judgment illustrates this by contrasting a 'much younger child' with an 'older' person who had become 'particular about his appearance.' The court treats appearance as significant to personal identity and likely attitudes, noting how someone who was a 'sportsman' and 'sociable young man' would view circumstances differently based on both their age and concern for appearance. The interpretation establishes that both age and appearance are material considerations that must be factored into assessments of what would be important to a person." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law demonstrates the distinction between ceremonies that may appear to be marriages versus those with actual legal effect. The court recognised that while the second ceremony 'may have been important in social and emotional terms', it 'had no legal impact' because the parties 'were already married'. This judicial interpretation shows that the statutory phrase encompasses ceremonies or arrangements that are claimed to be marriages but may lack legal validity. The terms 'alleged' and 'purported' in the legislation capture situations where marriage ceremonies are asserted or presented as creating marital status, regardless of whether they actually do so legally. The phrase 'as the case may be' indicates the terms are alternatives depending on the specific circumstances of how the marriage is characterised or presented." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph establishes that courts possess a 'general and wide discretion as to the award of costs' which represents a fundamental judicial power to determine monetary awards between parties. The term 'award' is interpreted judicially as encompassing the court's discretionary determination of sums payable, particularly in the context of costs orders. The case law demonstrates that this discretion operates across different procedural contexts (CPR and FPR), indicating that 'amount awarded' refers broadly to any court-determined monetary award rather than being limited to specific types of orders. The judicial interpretation emphasizes the discretionary nature of such awards, suggesting that 'amount awarded to a party' encompasses the court's evaluative decision-making process in determining appropriate monetary remedies or compensatory measures." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation places 'analogous institutions' within the context of child protection measures under international conventions. The court treats the term as part of a category alongside 'guardianship' and 'curatorship', indicating these are comparable legal arrangements. The judgment emphasizes that these institutions involve 'designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's person or property, representing or assisting the child'. The court's analysis shows that analogous institutions serve similar protective functions to guardianship and curatorship, establishing formal legal frameworks for care and representation. The comparison between the 1996 Hague Convention and Brussels IIA provisions confirms that analogous institutions encompass arrangements that are 'very similar' in subject matter to established guardianship concepts, focusing on legal responsibility for vulnerable persons' welfare and affairs." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that anonymity of the children is the central protective purpose underlying statutory restrictions in care proceedings. The court clarifies that these restrictions primarily serve to protect children's identities rather than professionals involved in the proceedings. The judge distinguishes between the strong protection afforded to children's anonymity and the more limited protection available to professionals, emphasizing that children are the primary beneficiaries of these statutory safeguards. This interpretation shows that anonymity of the children encompasses protection from identification through information disclosure, and that this protection takes precedence over other considerations such as professional anonymity in the context of care proceedings." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph focuses on the judicial treatment of lies in responses, establishing that when a lie is proven in answer to a question, courts must carefully assess its relevance to the ultimate facts in issue. The judicial interpretation recognizes that answering encompasses both truthful and false responses, and that the act of answering itself is distinct from the truthfulness of the content. The court's analysis shows that 'answering' covers the full spectrum of responses, with lies being a subset that requires particular judicial scrutiny for relevance and credibility assessment. The interpretation suggests that 'answering any question' captures all forms of responsive communication, regardless of veracity, with the judicial focus being on evaluating the significance and relevance of the response content rather than limiting the scope of what constitutes an 'answer'." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law demonstrates that a child's involvement in proceedings extends beyond mere formal participation to encompass situations where the child may be affected by the proceedings' conduct or outcomes. The court's consideration of identification risks shows that involvement includes circumstances where the child could recognise themselves from media reporting, with older children facing greater risk. The judicial interpretation emphasises that involvement encompasses the child's potential to experience embarrassment and distress from details of their life being in the public domain, even when anonymised. The court's approach to protective measures indicates that involvement is understood broadly to include any situation where the child's welfare or interests require judicial consideration, including protection from harassment and distress arising from the proceedings themselves." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph demonstrates judicial interpretation of the scope of court orders through discussion of the inherent jurisdiction. The court establishes that orders can be made under inherent jurisdiction, but only where there are 'imperative considerations of necessity' and 'absolutely no alternative'. The judge's analysis shows that 'any order' encompasses not just statutory orders but also those made under inherent jurisdiction, subject to strict necessity tests. The court's refusal to make an order because necessity could not be satisfied illustrates that 'any order' includes potential orders that courts may decline to make when legal tests are not met.

The court explicitly considers interim relief applications as part of 'the course of the proceedings', noting these may occur before trial and can be 'determinative' of the outcome. The judge distinguishes between interim stages (where immediate declarations might be made) and 'the final hearing', indicating proceedings span this entire temporal period. The court's consideration of whether to resolve legal issues 'now as opposed to being delayed to the trial' confirms that multiple decision points exist throughout the proceedings' duration.

    "reasoning" : "The provided case law paragraph does not directly interpret the term 'anyone engaged in caring for the person'. The paragraph focuses on judicial principles for determining a child's best interests in medical decisions, discussing the roles of doctors and parents in that context. While it mentions that courts must consider the views of doctors and parents as relevant parties in care decisions, it does not provide specific judicial interpretation of who constitutes 'anyone engaged in caring for the person' under the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that persons interested in welfare (exemplified by parents in this case) have views that must be given 'due respect and taken into account' in best interests determinations. However, the court emphasizes these views are subject to 'proper scrutiny' and are 'not wholly irrelevant' but also 'not determinative'. The judgment clarifies there is a crucial 'distinction between the views of a parent as to their child's best interests' and 'the independent wishes of the parent', indicating that the statutory category encompasses those with genuine welfare concerns rather than personal interests. The court references Article 8 rights and ECtHR authority requiring consideration of wishes of 'those close to the child', suggesting the statutory term covers individuals with recognized legal and emotional connections. The emphasis on 'objective assessment' of best interests separate from satisfying personal wishes indicates that qualification under this statutory category requires genuine welfare interest rather than self-interest." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph demonstrates how appeals operate in practice by examining a Court of Appeal case reviewing a lower court's factual finding. The reasoning shows: (1) Appeals involve challenging specific findings or decisions of lower courts, as evidenced by the ground of appeal that 'the judge was plainly wrong'; (2) The appellate court's role is to review whether the original decision was justified, not to make fresh determinations; (3) The standard applied is whether the judge was 'plainly wrong', indicating a deferential approach to trial judges' findings; (4) Particular deference is given to findings where the judge 'had seen and heard the evidence', recognizing the trial judge's advantageous position; (5) The review considers whether the decision fell within a 'reasonable range' available on the evidence.

    "reasoning" : "The case law demonstrates how 'appeal lies to the Court of Appeal' operates in practice. The paragraph shows the Court of Appeal exercising its appellate jurisdiction to review a trial judge's finding of fact about whether a child was in pain. The Court of Appeal examined whether 'the judge was plainly wrong to make a finding of fact', indicating that when an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, that court has the power to scrutinize factual determinations made by lower courts. The Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence that was before the trial judge, noted the judge's reasoning process in choosing between expert opinions, and ultimately upheld the judge's decision. This illustrates that when an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, it creates a mechanism whereby the appellate court can examine both the factual basis and legal reasoning of lower court decisions, applying standards such as whether the judge was 'plainly wrong'.

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph demonstrates that appeals relating to domestic abuse protection orders involve challenges to judicial decisions on multiple legal grounds. The court identifies three key areas of potential error: (1) misapplication of legal definitions that affect the analysis of domestic abuse cases, (2) failure to apply established case law and practice directions specifically relating to domestic abuse and coercive controlling behaviour, and (3) inappropriate weighing of evidence when assessing domestic abuse allegations. The judicial interpretation shows that such appeals scrutinise whether lower courts have correctly applied the legal framework governing domestic abuse cases, including definitional precision, adherence to precedent and practice directions, and proper evidential assessment.

The term 'application' appears to relate to formal requests made to courts for legal determinations. The context suggests this involves procedural mechanisms where parties seek court orders or determinations on specific legal issues.

In A City Council v. LS, the local authority made such an application requesting the High Court to use its inherent jurisdiction to authorise secure accommodation placement for a child not in their care. The judicial consideration of whether the court 'has power under its inherent jurisdiction' upon such application illustrates that these applications invoke the court's residual common law powers. The court's analysis of its capacity to act 'upon the application of a local authority' demonstrates that such applications are formal requests for the court to exercise discretionary powers that exist independently of specific statutory provisions.

The court's recognition that the Schedule 1 application 'remains a live application' despite procedural suspension indicates that competent making establishes the application's fundamental validity and the applicant's entitlement to bring it.

The court's treatment of the application as procedurally valid but temporarily suspended demonstrates that competent making relates to the proper initiation and foundational validity of proceedings rather than their ongoing management." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that local authorities have limited statutory powers and cannot regulate, control, compel, restrain, confine or coerce without either specific statutory authority or court sanction. The court identifies 'application to court' as one of three core duties of local authorities, alongside investigation and provision of supporting services. Critically, the judgment establishes that even when emergency protective steps are justified due to immediate threat to life or limb, any such intervention must be followed up with an immediate application to court. This creates both a permissive pathway (seeking court sanction for actions beyond statutory powers) and a mandatory requirement (following up emergency interventions). The term therefore encompasses both proactive applications for authority and reactive applications following emergency action." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph discusses the distinction between legal requirements and good practice regarding when applications should be brought to court. The judicial interpretation emphasizes that applications to appropriate judicial bodies serve as formal mechanisms for obtaining necessary determinations, and that failure to make such applications where required (whether as legal obligation or good practice) can result in criticism and disciplinary consequences. The term 'appropriate tribunal' encompasses the concept of the correct judicial forum having jurisdiction over the specific matter. The interpretation suggests that such applications are procedural safeguards ensuring proper oversight and authorization for significant decisions, particularly in contexts where professional judgment intersects with legal requirements." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation emphasizes that making an application under section 79E represents 'an attempt to bring the child back within the regulatory regime mandated by Parliament.' The court distinguishes between providers who make applications (even if unsuccessful) versus those who refuse or cannot apply, highlighting that the application itself is the mechanism for engaging with the statutory regulatory framework. The judgment stresses that applications provide the regulator with 'a chance to consider the placement' and enable potential improvements toward 'a successful registration application in due course.' This indicates that section 79E applications are formal regulatory submissions that trigger supervisory oversight and potential compliance pathways within the mandatory children's home registration system." ,

The Supreme Court in Re T describes applications made 'to the court under its inherent jurisdiction', showing that such applications are formal requests to judicial authorities seeking specific legal determinations. The context reveals that these applications seek court authorization for particular actions (in this case, deprivation of liberty), indicating that 'application under this section' encompasses formal judicial processes where statutory provisions empower parties to seek court intervention or approval. The phrase 'under this section' specifically ties the application to the statutory framework, distinguishing it from general court applications by requiring compliance with the particular procedural and substantive requirements of the relevant statutory section." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation distinguishes between different routes for acquiring parental responsibility. The court identifies that parental responsibility can be gained through: (1) automatic operation of law (such as birth registration), (2) court orders following welfare analysis, and (3) other mechanisms including agreements. The judgment emphasizes these are 'separate and different route[s]' for acquiring parental responsibility. While the paragraph does not directly define parental responsibility agreements, it establishes the conceptual framework that such agreements constitute a distinct legal mechanism for conferring parental responsibility, separate from both automatic acquisition and court-ordered acquisition. The court's analysis of different pathways to parental responsibility demonstrates that agreements represent a formal contractual route that operates independently of judicial welfare assessments." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph demonstrates that applications for the return of a child result in specific judicial determinations - either 'return orders' or 'non-return orders'. The judicial interpretation shows these applications operate within a framework where courts make substantive decisions that can be subject to setting aside in exceptional circumstances. The reference to '1980 Hague Convention' indicates these applications encompass international child abduction cases. The court's ability to make return orders or non-return orders shows these applications seek judicial determination of whether a child should be returned to their original jurisdiction.

The context of Re X (A child: Parental Order: Time Limit) establishes that 'the making of the order' refers to the court's formal decision-making process in parental order applications. The phrase 'where a court is invited to read down the section 54 criteria' suggests that 'the making of the order' encompasses the court's evaluative process and ultimate determination.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation emphasizes that an appropriate authority must possess 'objective and dispassionate' qualities when conducting investigations or related proceedings. The court establishes that such authority involves the power to make determinations about engagement or disengagement from proceedings, suggesting discretionary powers balanced by judicial oversight. The reference to 'cross-check' procedures and permission requirements indicates that appropriate authority operates within a framework of checks and balances.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that 'appropriate' involves a multi-stage assessment. First, the court must determine whether it is 'appropriate or not to make an order in the first place' based on connections with England and Wales. Second, hardship or injustice, while not conditions of jurisdiction, 'may make it appropriate in the light of all the circumstances, for an order to be made'.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that appropriateness involves a two-stage inter-related assessment under sections 16-18. First, the court examines venue appropriateness considering all circumstances and particular factors. Second, it determines whether an order should be made having regard to section 18 matters. The interpretation clarifies that appropriateness does not require exceptionality as a condition, but mere disparity with English awards is insufficient where adequate foreign proceedings occurred. However, hardship or injustice may make an order appropriate and affect its nature. The court emphasizes that appropriateness depends on the legislative purpose of alleviating adverse consequences of inadequate foreign provision where substantial English connections exist. Strong English connections may justify treating the application as purely English proceedings, while the strength of English connections affects both appropriateness and the nature of provision ordered." ,

The court's discussion of scenarios where 'there is no approved secure accommodation available' demonstrates that availability is a key practical element of the concept. The reference to 'section 25 compliant secure accommodation' suggests that not all secure accommodation automatically qualifies as 'approved' - it must specifically meet the statutory standards. The court's concern about the 'serious shortage of approved Placements' reinforces that this is a distinct category of accommodation with specific compliance requirements, separate from general secure accommodation provision." ,

The court emphasizes that willingness 'is given freely and voluntarily' and 'may not be inferred from silence or passivity.' When applied to someone who is 'asleep or otherwise unconscious,' this framework indicates such persons fundamentally lack the necessary capacity for active consent since they cannot provide the required 'active' demonstration of willingness. The reference to 'incapacitated person' in the judicial framework supports interpreting unconsciousness as a state preventing the exercise of choice regarding consent.

The court emphasizes that establishing whether someone is 'specially qualified' requires demonstrable evidence of their professional competence. Crucially, the judgment indicates that qualifications must be established through 'authority (in terms of statute, regulation or other provision)' - showing that 'specially qualified' status cannot be presumed but must be proven through formal legal standards. The court's focus on 'professional competence' as the substantive test, combined with the requirement for statutory or regulatory backing, demonstrates that 'specially qualified' encompasses both substantive expertise and formal recognition of that expertise through legal authority." ,

The court recognizes that domestic abuse victims experience vulnerability that affects their ability to participate and give evidence. The reference to Section 63 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 shows the court's assumption that participation and evidence will be diminished by reason of vulnerability. This judicial interpretation links fear or distress to the practical impact on a person's capacity to engage with legal processes. The mention of extensive provisions for vulnerable witnesses indicates that assistance encompasses formal measures and support mechanisms.

This indicates that assuming jurisdiction requires establishing a legitimate basis for the court's authority. The reference to 'orderly legal relationships in the international world' and the need for judicial outcomes to be 'relied upon in all others' suggests that assuming jurisdiction involves a court's deliberate acceptance of its authority to adjudicate. The context of gateway requirements and discretionary stages indicates that assuming jurisdiction is an active process where courts evaluate and then accept their authority rather than it being automatic.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that assumption of parental rights and powers occurs through a two-stage process: first, the undertaking of responsibilities for primary care of a child, and second, the acquisition of corresponding rights and powers that flow from those responsibilities. The court emphasizes that this assumption occurs in specific circumstances - where there is no other person with legal responsibility available to care for the child. The court uses the phrase 'assumed complete responsibility for the primary care' to describe this concept, indicating that the assumption must be comprehensive rather than partial. The court also confirms that the rights and powers are 'concomitant' to the responsibilities undertaken, meaning they arise as a natural consequence of assuming care responsibilities. The temporal aspect is also significant - the assumption occurs at a specific point in time when care responsibilities are taken on, and continues until those responsibilities cease." ,

In this Mental Capacity Act context, the court repeatedly uses the phrase to pinpoint 24 October 2019 when the Consent Order was signed, establishing this as the crucial time for capacity assessment. The phrase appears three times in paragraph 9.3, each time linking the temporal element to substantive legal determinations: first regarding the impairment of mind, second concerning decision-making ability, and third relating to the capacity assessment overall.

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph demonstrates judicial interpretation of age 18 as a threshold for legal capacity and decision-making ability. Lord Hailsham's distinction shows that the courts view age 18 as the point where a person 'would in all probability have been able to' exercise informed choice regarding treatment decisions. This judicial interpretation establishes that attaining age 18 is not merely a chronological milestone, but represents a legal presumption of capacity for informed decision-making. The contrast drawn between someone who 'would never be able to exercise an informed choice' due to mental incapacity versus someone who would be able to do so 'once she reached the age of 18' indicates that the courts treat this age threshold as creating a presumption of legal capacity and autonomous decision-making ability." ,

The court identifies this as one factor among a range to be considered when evaluating hearsay evidence. The term is presented as describing circumstances that would negatively impact the court's assessment process - specifically those that would 'suggest' such an attempt. The interpretation indicates this relates to the court's ability to conduct its evaluative function regarding evidence, with 'proper evaluation' referring to the court's standard judicial assessment of evidential weight.

The court treats attribution as one of four distinct processes affecting parental responsibility: attribution, exercise, termination, and restriction. By listing attribution first and separately from 'exercise', the court indicates that attribution is the foundational process of conferring or assigning parental responsibility to a person. The context shows this occurs within formal legal proceedings concerning child welfare, where courts must determine who should hold parental responsibility. The judicial interpretation emphasizes that attribution is a 'general matter' covered by both the 1996 Hague Convention and Brussels IIA, indicating it is a fundamental concept in family law proceedings involving the assignment of legal authority over children." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation demonstrates that authorization to place a child for adoption requires: (1) a welfare analysis conducted by the court focusing on the child's life-long welfare interests, (2) a comparative assessment of competing placement options, (3) a determination that adoption placement is the only viable option by which the child's needs can be safely met, and (4) consideration of whether parental consent should be dispensed with. The court emphasizes that this authorization follows from a judicial finding that the child's welfare requires this course of action, indicating it is a formal legal authority granted by the court rather than an administrative decision. The phrase 'must now...be authorised' suggests this is a mandatory consequence flowing from the welfare determination, establishing that authorization is the legal mechanism enabling the local authority to proceed with adoption placement." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph demonstrates that 'final decree' encompasses a 'final judgment' that provides definitive resolution of proceedings. The court refers to awaiting 'resolution in the form of a final judgment in the Russian divorce proceedings', indicating that a final decree constitutes the formal judicial determination that conclusively settles the substantive matters before the court. The temporal aspect 'before or after' creates two distinct periods: the pre-decree period when proceedings remain unresolved (as evidenced by the application remaining 'live' but 'suspended'), and the post-decree period following formal resolution.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation demonstrates that 'best interests of the child' operates as the primary test for determining appropriate outcomes in legal proceedings involving children. The court emphasizes that this standard is 'paramount' and takes precedence over other factors, including parental actions such as 'self-help' by the mother. The judge's analysis shows that while there is a general legal principle against self-help and preference for restoring the status quo ante, these considerations are subordinated to what serves the child's best interests. The court conducts a comprehensive assessment ('pulling the threads together') of all circumstances before concluding what would be in the child's best interests, indicating this requires a holistic evaluation of the child's welfare rather than a narrow or technical application of rules." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation reveals that courts must work within practical constraints when making orders. The paragraph establishes that even when a case is identified as a 'needs' case, the court is not obligated to satisfy both parties' needs if resources are insufficient. The phrase 'best that can be made' encompasses situations where assets may be 'barely sufficient' or 'not sufficient' to meet all requirements. This interpretation emphasizes that the court must optimize outcomes within existing limitations rather than achieve ideal solutions. The judge's approach of categorizing cases based on asset sufficiency demonstrates that 'best that can be made' requires balancing competing demands against available resources, acknowledging that the optimal solution may fall short of meeting all identified needs." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation in Re S demonstrates that this statutory test requires active judicial assessment of whether intervention is beneficial. The Court of Appeal emphasizes that 'it will only make orders when it is better than not to do so', showing this is a positive threshold requiring demonstrated benefit. The court must 'take action when and where it can do so to the child's advantage', indicating orders should only be made where they will improve the child's position. The judgment shows courts must consider whether their powers will be 'effective as opposed to ineffective', meaning orders must actually benefit rather than merely address a theoretical concern.

The court recognises this as a process subject to special restrictions imposed by the Secretary of State based on child safeguarding concerns. The interpretation shows that the term encompasses not merely physical transportation, but the entire process of facilitating children's entry from foreign jurisdictions for adoption purposes. The court's analysis demonstrates that this process must meet specific safeguarding requirements and can be restricted where there are concerns about the adoption system of the originating country, including issues with documentation, adoptability confirmation, and trafficking risks.

The court's analysis shows this term operates within the statutory framework of section 9 of the Children and Adoption Act 2006, where it serves as the basis for imposing special restrictions. The interpretation demonstrates that this bringing can be subject to policy considerations regarding public interest - specifically, it can be restricted where it would be 'contrary to public policy' based on child safeguarding concerns. The court recognizes that this bringing occurs 'for the purpose of adoption' in intercountry adoption contexts, but the term itself encompasses the broader concept of causing children's entry into the UK.

The court distinguishes between dispensing with consent (where the person could potentially be contacted) and situations where 'concerted efforts have been made to contact' the person but they still 'cannot be found'. This establishes that the term requires: (1) systematic attempts at location/contact, (2) failure of those attempts, and (3) the person remaining untraceable. The court views this as creating a meaningful legal distinction from other grounds for proceeding without consent, emphasizing the procedural requirement of demonstrable effort before the 'cannot be found' criterion is satisfied." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes this as a disjunctive test with two distinct limbs. The first limb ('cannot be found') relates to physical unavailability where location attempts have failed. The second limb ('lacks capacity to give consent') concerns mental or legal incapacity to comprehend the consent decision. The court treats these as alternative grounds, either of which can satisfy the statutory requirement.

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph establishes that absence of willingness occurs when there is 'no freedom and capacity to make that choice', specifically including situations involving 'a person intoxicated by drink and/or drugs'. This judicial interpretation directly connects to the statutory term by explaining that substances or other means that stupefy or overpower remove a person's capacity for willing participation. The court emphasizes that willingness must be 'given freely and voluntarily' and that 'mutuality, enjoyment, and welcomeness are indicators of consent', while noting that a person who 'simply freezes with no protest or resistance is unlikely to be consenting'. This framework demonstrates that being stupefied or overpowered fundamentally undermines the mental and physical capacity necessary for genuine willingness, as it prevents the active, free choice that the court identifies as essential for valid consent." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph places this term within the statutory framework of s.58(3) of the Mental Health Act 1983, where it operates as a threshold test for medical treatment consent. The judicial interpretation establishes that this capacity assessment has three distinct components that must be understood by the patient: (1) the 'nature' referring to what the treatment actually involves or consists of; (2) the 'purpose' relating to the reason or objective for which the treatment is being proposed; and (3) the 'likely effects' encompassing the consequences that may reasonably be expected to result from the treatment. The paragraph demonstrates that this test functions as a gatekeeping mechanism - where a patient lacks this understanding capacity, treatment may proceed without consent subject to appropriate medical certification.

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph illustrates that capacity to consent is not absolute or permanent through the example of a 15-year-old who demonstrated capacity during a 'lucid moment' when she refused treatment. The judicial interpretation shows that even when a minor demonstrates capacity to consent (being described as 'competent'), this capacity can still be overridden by the Court exercising its wardship jurisdiction. This indicates that capacity to consent involves both the cognitive ability to understand and make decisions, and recognition that such capacity may be temporal or conditional, particularly for minors under mental health legislation." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph establishes that 'care and accommodation' is a composite concept requiring both elements to be present simultaneously. The judicial interpretation emphasizes that when a child receives 'care with accommodation', this triggers the statutory definition of a 'children's home' under s.1(2) of the Care Standards Act 2000, thereby engaging mandatory registration obligations. The court specifically notes that children subject to deprivation of liberty orders are 'highly likely to be receiving care with accommodation', indicating that this term encompasses situations where residential placement is combined with care services to meet children's needs. The interpretation connects this provision directly to the statutory scheme's protective purpose for vulnerable children, suggesting that 'care and accommodation' refers to integrated service provision rather than separate or incidental arrangements." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation in paragraph 36 establishes that 'care given to the child' is assessed in the context of risk evaluation and protective measures. The court considers the adequacy of care when determining whether a child should remain with or be removed from parents/carers. The paragraph demonstrates that care is evaluated against potential 'significant harm' and influences decisions about legal orders and placement arrangements. The court's reference to 'placement with parents under an interim or final order' and compliance with 'statutory regulations for placement at home' indicates that care encompasses not only the immediate provision for the child but also the legal framework ensuring appropriate standards. This interpretation connects to the Children Act 1989's welfare principle, where care quality directly impacts judicial decisions about child protection and placement." ,

The court identifies that this encompasses 'supervision by a public authority of the care of a child by any person having charge of them', indicating a supervisory relationship where public authorities monitor care arrangements. The interpretation connects this to broader child protection measures including guardianship, curatorship, foster care placement, and institutional care arrangements. The court's analysis shows that 'care of a child' is not limited to direct care provision but extends to supervisory oversight of care arrangements by public bodies.

The court establishes that these proceedings are subject to statutory restrictions on information publication, which is a defining feature. The purpose of these restrictions is clearly articulated as protecting the anonymity of children and possibly their families involved in the proceedings. The court distinguishes between the protection afforded to children and families versus professionals, indicating that care proceedings involve children as central parties requiring special protection. The reference to statutory restrictions implies these are proceedings governed by specific statutory frameworks that mandate confidentiality measures.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes a clear distinction between those who 'carry on or manage' establishments and those who merely arrange services with them. The court specifically noted that the offence under s.11(5) 'applies to providers of the children's home and not to a local authority making an arrangement with such a setting.' This indicates that 'carries on or manages' encompasses provider functions - both the business operation ('carries on') and direct operational control ('manages'). The exclusion of local authorities making arrangements demonstrates that commissioning or contracting services does not constitute carrying on or managing. The interpretation suggests two distinct but related activities: 'carries on' refers to conducting the business or service provision, while 'manages' refers to having direct control over operations." ,

The court identifies welfare concerns as a key indicator of urgency, particularly where a vulnerable person requires protection. The judgment establishes that urgency can be both initial (when first brought before the court) and continuing (where concerns remain as urgent as ever).

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation in Re D, L, and LA demonstrates that courts recognise both formal and informal means of changing how a child is known. The Court of Appeal's pragmatic approval of a name change that had been 'unilaterally' introduced by foster carers shows that 'causing a child to be known by' a new name encompasses practical, everyday usage rather than merely formal legal designation. The court's focus on the practical reality that the child was already being called by the new name, and the potential upset of reverting to the original name, indicates that the term covers situations where the change has occurred through habitual use. The emphasis on the burden and difficulty that would result from undoing the change suggests that 'causing to be known by' includes both the initial act of introducing the new surname and the ongoing practice of using it, regardless of whether formal legal procedures were followed." ,

    "reasoning" : "The paragraph discusses fear as a circumstance that negates freedom and capacity to make choices. Specifically, it identifies 'a person threated by violence, deceived, or in fear' as lacking freedom and capacity, placing fear alongside threats of violence and deception as circumstances that compromise a person's ability to make voluntary decisions. The judicial interpretation treats fear as a psychological state that undermines genuine willingness and consent. The court recognizes that fear operates as a coercive factor that prevents true voluntary choice, even without explicit threats or violence.

    "reasoning" : "The case law establishes that orders lasting until a child reaches 16 constitute 'an exceptional step' requiring special judicial consideration. The court emphasizes that such duration represents 'an acknowledgement that nothing more can be done' and requires the court to 'spell out why' such extensive duration is necessary. The judicial interpretation connects this age limit to the principle of proportionality, where 'the degree of restriction is to be proportionate to the harm it is intended to avoid' and courts must 'carefully consider the extent of the restriction to be imposed and specify...the duration of order'. The case law treats cessation at age 16 as a significant temporal boundary in family law proceedings, particularly in restriction orders, requiring enhanced judicial scrutiny due to its exceptional nature." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that section 4(2A) creates a mandatory court requirement for termination of parental responsibility. The court emphasizes that this provision is 'clear in its terms' and applies specifically to fathers who have acquired parental responsibility through the three routes identified in section 4(1). The interpretation confirms that this represents an absolute requirement - the word 'only' creates an exclusive condition that court intervention is necessary for cessation. The court distinguishes this mandatory termination process from the acquisition process, noting there is 'no requirement for a welfare analysis for a father to acquire parental responsibility through registration,' but the termination requires judicial oversight.

The certification must address specific substantive matters within the certifier's professional competence - in this case, the patient's capacity to understand treatment and the appropriateness of proposed medical intervention.

The court identifies this term within the context of measures covered by international conventions, specifically noting it includes 'designation and functions of any person or body having charge of the child's person or property.' The interpretation shows this covers both physical custody/care aspects ('person') and financial/asset management aspects ('property').

The court emphasizes that local authorities must obtain court approval when they lack statutory power to take compulsory steps. In the context of child assessment orders under the Children Act 1989, this means such orders provide the necessary judicial authorization for local authorities to conduct assessments where they cannot otherwise compel cooperation. The court's requirement that local authorities must 'obtain the appropriate sanction of the court' when lacking statutory power directly supports the function of child assessment orders as judicial instruments that bridge the gap between limited local authority powers and the need to assess children's welfare." ,

    "definition" : "Child concerned is present in England and Wales means the physical location of the child within the territorial boundaries of England and Wales at the relevant time, which serves as a jurisdictional basis for the High Court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction over that child." ,
    "reasoning" : "The paragraph demonstrates that Parliament, through sections 1(1)(d), 2(3) and 3(1) of the Family Law Act 1986, established strict limitations on when the High Court can exercise its inherent jurisdiction over children. The court identifies three specific jurisdictional gateways: the Brussels 2 regulation, the 1996 Hague Convention, or 'by virtue of the child's presence in England and Wales.' The judicial interpretation treats the child's presence as a distinct jurisdictional foundation that enables the court's powers, separate from international conventions or regulations. The context shows this presence requirement acts as a statutory restriction on the court's otherwise broad inherent jurisdiction, meaning physical presence within the territorial jurisdiction is both necessary and sufficient to establish this particular head of jurisdiction." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph interprets 'removed from' in the context of taking children from a jurisdiction (England and Wales) with intent for permanent relocation, characterizing this as 'wrongful removal'. This indicates that removal involves the physical taking of a child from one jurisdiction to another. The judicial interpretation suggests that the wrongfulness stems from the action being contrary to existing custody rights or jurisdictional authority. The term 'retained outside' would logically follow the same principle but apply to keeping a child outside the jurisdiction rather than the initial taking. The court's focus on intent and the wrongful nature of the act indicates that both removal and retention must be assessed against the legal framework governing custody and jurisdictional rights." ,

    "reasoning" : "The provided paragraph does not contain direct judicial interpretation of the specific term 'child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm'. Instead, it discusses regulatory protection and safeguarding requirements in the context of deprivation of liberty orders. The paragraph emphasizes the vulnerability of children subject to such orders and the need for regulatory protection 'to safeguard and promote his or her welfare'. While this demonstrates the broader safeguarding context in which the harm threshold operates, it does not provide specific judicial guidance on what constitutes 'significant harm' or the likelihood test. The definition therefore relies on general legal understanding of this statutory threshold test from the Children Act 1989, acknowledging that the paragraph provides limited interpretive guidance on the specific elements of the term." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation reveals that this legal term creates a complete legal severance of existing parent-child relationships upon adoption. The court identified that making a section 51(1) order would 'remove his mother and her family legally from his parentage', demonstrating that the term operates to eliminate all pre-existing legal parental connections. The court's analysis shows this is a binary legal transformation - either the child remains legally connected to biological parents, or becomes exclusively the legal child of adopters with all other legal parentage removed. The judge's concern about the 'negative impact' of removing the mother's family 'legally from his parentage' confirms that this provision effects a complete legal substitution of parentage rather than an addition to existing relationships. The court's reference to 'elevation of the applicant to the status of parent rather than alteration of anything in terms of parentage on the maternal side' further clarifies that the provision creates exclusive legal parentage in the adopters by severing all other legal parent-child relationships." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that 'child or young person' encompasses individuals who possess specific protected rights and freedoms that require special consideration. The court emphasizes that any intervention affecting such individuals must meet strict criteria: measures must be the least restrictive of their rights and freedoms, proportionate to anticipated harm, minimal but sufficient to ensure safety of the child and others, and respectful of the child's dignity. This interpretation demonstrates that the term carries inherent protections requiring a balancing test between necessary intervention and preservation of fundamental rights.

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation reveals that a sixteen-year-old occupies a distinctive legal position with enhanced autonomy. The court emphasises that at sixteen, a person 'can legally marry' and is capable of making 'sensible and informed decisions' about their future. Crucially, the judgment establishes that a sixteen-year-old is 'outside the usual ambit' of courts to make Children Act orders, indicating reduced judicial intervention powers. The court's reference to the child's assertion that 'no one-including a judge-could tell her what she must do' reflects judicial recognition of their enhanced autonomy. However, the continued reference to 'AB' as existing within the family court framework confirms they retain child status under the Act, creating a hybrid legal position combining child status with enhanced decision-making capacity and reduced court jurisdiction." ,

Integration may develop quickly, does not require permanence or full integration, and depends on the child’s age and circumstances, including the role of carers for younger children.

	"reasoning": "Section 31 of the Children Act 1989 defines a care order and sets the mandatory threshold conditions: the court must be satisfied that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm attributable to inadequate parental care or lack of parental control. Section 33 sets out the legal effects of a care order, namely that the local authority must receive and keep the child in its care and acquires parental responsibility, with authority to limit the exercise of parental responsibility by others where necessary to safeguard or promote the child’s welfare. The case law emphasises that making a care order is a grave interference with family life and must comply with the ‘no order’ principle in section 1(5) CA 1989, meaning it should only be made where it is better for the child than making no order. Judicial authority further establishes that care orders should not be used merely as a vehicle to secure services or support, that they require necessity and proportionality, and that exceptional justification is required where a care order is sought on a plan for the child to remain living with parents. Together, the statutory provisions and authorities show that a care order is a coercive public law order conferring defined legal powers on a local authority, justified only where the statutory threshold and welfare tests are met.",

	"reasoning": "The statutory text from Section 116 of the Children Act 1989 indicates that a 'care order' vests parental rights and powers in the local authority, allowing them to act in place of the parents for a child or young person. Case law further clarifies the scope of the local authority's responsibilities under a care order, particularly when exercising decisions that affect the child's liberty or placement. Paragraph 71 of Re T highlights that children placed under local authority care in unregistered facilities are still under statutory protection for welfare and safety, emphasizing that the care order empowers the authority to make necessary welfare arrangements. Paragraph 21 confirms that any deprivation of liberty must be authorised only when necessary, proportionate, and in the child's best interests, reinforcing that the care order confers decision-making authority subject to legal safeguards.

Judicial interpretation, particularly in cases such as Re J, An NHS Trust v MB, Re A, and more recent cases like Re Archie Battersbee and Kwame, confirms that decisions regarding such treatment must be made in the patient's best interests, considering medical prognosis, quality of life, suffering, and other welfare factors. The courts emphasise a strong but rebuttable presumption in favour of preserving life, balanced against pain, suffering, and minimal quality-of-life benefits (paras 17, 49, 82, 85, 99, 104, 109). Additionally, parental or family views are relevant but subordinate to the objective best interests of the patient (paras 51, 82, 49). Life-sustaining treatment may also justify temporary deprivation of liberty under section 4B when necessary to provide the treatment (section 4B).

	"definition": "Significant harm means ill-treatment or the impairment of a child's health or development, including physical, emotional, or psychological harm, which is serious in nature and more than minor or trivial, such that intervention by a court or authority is justified to safeguard the child’s welfare. Where relevant, the child’s health or development is to be compared with that which could reasonably be expected of a similar child.",
	"reasoning": "Step 1: Review of statutory provisions. Section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 defines harm as ill-treatment or impairment of health or development, including physical, emotional, or behavioral aspects. The threshold for making a care or supervision order requires that the child is suffering or likely to suffer 'significant harm'. Section 31(10) clarifies that where harm depends on health or development, it should be compared to that expected for a similar child.\n\nStep 2: Examination of case law. Multiple cases highlight the application and interpretation of 'significant harm':\n- Re 2020/2741 and Re 2020/1903 show that courts consider both the likelihood and severity of harm, including psychological and physical risks, in determining the threshold.\n- Re 2021/1191 emphasises that significant harm represents serious intervention by the state, justifying removal or orders only when necessary and proportionate.\n- Re 2023/347 and Re 2023/2753 demonstrate that 'significant harm' encompasses risk of serious physical or emotional injury from medical, familial, or environmental circumstances.\n- Re 2021/2931 and Re 2020/2741 also indicate the risk assessment involves evaluating delays, parental capacity, and potential deprivation of liberty, linking harm to welfare outcomes.\n\nStep 3: Synthesis. From these judicial interpretations, 'significant harm' is not merely minor or transient detriment but a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or psychological injury that necessitates protective intervention. The comparison with a normal child of similar age and circumstances ensures objective assessment. This aligns statutory intent with judicial application.",

	"definition": "Significant harm means harm of a serious or substantial nature that is likely to have a considerable impact on the health, safety, or well-being of the person for whose protection a court order is sought.",
	"reasoning": "The statutory text of section 34(3)(a) of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 instructs the court to consider whether there is any risk that the respondent will cause 'significant harm' if a domestic abuse protection order is not made immediately. The legislative context implies that the harm must be serious enough to justify immediate intervention. The case law paragraph (EWCH Fam 2022/2755 para 44) emphasizes the court's duty to assess the impact of domestic abuse on all parties, including children, considering the conduct of both parents and the resulting effects. Although the paragraph does not explicitly define 'significant harm', it illustrates that judicial interpretation involves evaluating the severity and foreseeable consequences of conduct on affected individuals. Combining these insights, 'significant harm' is understood as harm with serious or substantial consequences affecting health, safety, or well-being, sufficient to warrant urgent protective measures.",

	"definition": "Removal of any child means the taking or retention of a child from their state of habitual residence in breach of the custody rights of a person entitled to exercise those rights at the time, without that person's consent or acquiescence, in a manner contrary to the terms of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.",
	"reasoning": "The statutory text (s.8 of the 1985 Act) defines a wrongful removal as one that contravenes Article 3 of the Hague Convention, and requires a court declaration. Case law (paras 33, 34, 57, 63, 67, 96, 126, 145) clarifies that wrongful removal occurs where: (i) the child is taken or retained without the consent or acquiescence of the parent or guardian holding custody rights; (ii) the child was habitually resident in the requesting state at the time; (iii) the parent asserting wrongful removal must be exercising or entitled to exercise custody rights; (iv) a removal is wrongful at the specific time and place it occurs, irrespective of subsequent legal orders (para 18); (v) the child's views and welfare are considered at the discretion stage but do not determine whether the removal is legally wrongful (paras 101, 145). Additional considerations, such as habitual residence and exceptions under Article 13, help define the circumstances in which a removal may be excused, but the core definition centers on the breach of custody rights and lack of consent/acquiescence.",

	"reasoning": "Statute and case law treat the risk of suffering harm as a forward-looking welfare concept embedded in the Children Act 1989 welfare checklist. The court’s task is not confined to past harm but requires rigorous evaluation of future risk, including the nature, seriousness and potential impact of the harm feared. Judicial authority makes clear that there is no minimum threshold of probability: the greater the gravity of the harm, the smaller the degree of risk required to justify protective measures. Harm may arise in many forms, including emotional and psychological harm, exposure to domestic abuse, sexual risk, instability, or deterioration in mental health, and need not be quantifiable or capable of precise measurement. Courts are entitled to take account of unquantifiable or uncertain risks, patterns of behaviour, lack of insight, and cumulative allegations. The assessment is holistic, balancing competing risks (for example, the risk of harm from contact against the risk of harm from absence of contact), informed by professional evidence, and focused on safeguarding the child’s welfare rather than requiring proof that harm will probably occur.",

The judgment clarifies that participation must be assessed not merely by whether appropriate measures (such as special measures) were available or provided, but by whether their absence prevented fair participation to such an extent that it breached natural justice and materially affected the case outcome.

The court assessed whether C had 'a school to return to' as part of evaluating the realistic nature of the proposed arrangements, indicating that educational continuity is a key component. The judgment further considers educational needs within the broader context of meeting 'all C's welfare needs: physical, educational and emotional', showing that educational provision must be evaluated alongside other welfare factors. The court's assessment that the proposal would allow M to 'return to her legal training and to provide for C' suggests that the term encompasses not only the child's direct educational needs but also the capacity of carers to support those needs through their own training and development.

Case law demonstrates that courts evaluate allegations cumulatively, considering the overall impact on victims rather than isolating individual acts (EWCH Fam 2023/2082 para 40). Courts recognize both physical and emotional abuse, coercive control, and verbal demeanment as constituting domestic abuse (EWCH Fam 2023/2983 paras 111, 134, 135). Allegations need not be proven to be considered in protective measures, highlighting the emphasis on the effect and risk posed by the behaviour rather than solely on findings of fact (EWCH Fam 2023/505 para 42; EWCH Fam 2022/2755 para 26). The inclusion of children as victims under section 3 extends the concept to exposure to abuse or its effects, reflecting the Act’s comprehensive approach to protecting both adults and children from a broad spectrum of harmful conduct.

	"reasoning": "The Domestic Abuse Act 2021, as referenced in section 31T of the Family Law Act 1984, explicitly provides that 'domestic abuse' has the meaning given by the 2021 Act. The case-law paragraph (para 87, EWHC 3480 (Fam)) emphasizes the court's approach to evaluating domestic abuse, highlighting that a lack of acknowledgment of abusive behaviour is relevant to assessing the risk of repetition or future harm. This underscores that domestic abuse is understood not merely as isolated acts but as conduct that can be assessed for ongoing risk, encompassing patterns of behaviour that can be controlling or coercive.

The court identified that C's particular needs included: (1) physical needs related to having a suitable home and care arrangements; (2) educational needs regarding schooling and development; (3) emotional needs, specifically the need to develop relationships including with both parents and the removal of causes of emotional distress. The court treated these needs as interconnected, noting that C's emotional hostility towards the father was linked to being prevented from returning to Germany, and that meeting her need to return would potentially address her emotional need for a parental relationship. The interpretation shows that 'particular needs' requires individualized assessment rather than generic application, as the court specifically considered C's unique circumstances, relationships, and psychological state. The court balanced immediate needs against medium to long-term prospects, indicating that 'particular needs' encompasses both present requirements and future welfare considerations. The judicial approach demonstrates that these needs must be assessed holistically, weighing risks and benefits across all welfare dimensions to determine what arrangement best serves the child's overall wellbeing." ,

Second, the judgment characterizes consent as 'the cornerstone of the legislative scheme', indicating its central statutory importance. Third, the court emphasizes that the underlying purpose is ensuring 'a donor's wishes are respected', which it describes as 'the primary legislative objective'. The interpretation distinguishes between the substantive requirement of consent (based on autonomy and respecting wishes) and procedural requirements for evidencing consent, suggesting that the core legal requirement is the voluntary agreement itself rather than its form of documentation." ,

    "reasoning" : "The case law paragraph demonstrates the practical application of jurisdictional conventions in cross-border family disputes. The court examines competing jurisdictions between Portugal and England regarding child arrangements, with specific reference to determining which court is 'better placed to assess the welfare and quality of life of the child.' This shows that Convention on Jurisdiction operates to establish clear rules about court authority in international family cases. The paragraph reveals that such conventions work alongside domestic proceedings (the 'Hague application' mentioned) and involve considerations of the child's current residence and situation. The judicial interpretation shows that jurisdictional conventions provide framework for resolving conflicts between different national courts' authority, particularly in sensitive family matters involving children's welfare across borders." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that 'Convention right must take into account' operates as a mandatory interpretive principle under section 3 HRA. The court identifies that this requires dual consideration: (i) Parliament's intention and (ii) any possible construction compatible with Convention rights. The judge emphasizes that courts must ensure Convention rights are 'practical and effective' not 'theoretical and illusory', establishing a substantive standard. The interpretation shows this principle applies when legislation potentially interferes with factual family relationships, requiring courts to adopt constructions that provide 'real and effective' protection. The judicial approach demonstrates that 'taking into account' Convention rights is an active interpretive duty that may require reading legislation in ways that uphold human rights protection, particularly where family life under Article 8 is engaged." ,

    "reasoning" : "The judicial interpretation establishes that the Court of Appeal operates as a distinct tier in the judicial hierarchy with specific characteristics. The court emphasizes that appeals differ fundamentally from first instance trials because at the appellate stage, both factual findings and judicial reasoning are already established and known to parties. This creates different procedural expectations and standards of reasonableness for party conduct.

The court exercised authority over a person (Mr Casey) who lacked capacity to make medical decisions for himself. The judge made a determination about what was in the person's best interests regarding brain stem testing and issued an order permitting specific medical procedures. This shows the court's dual function: (1) making best interests determinations for those lacking capacity, and (2) having the power to authorize specific actions through formal orders.

The court examined parental intentions regarding the child's relocation and determined habitual residence in Romania despite the child being retained in England. This demonstrates that custody encompasses not just physical care but also the legal determination of where a child should reside based on various factors including parental intentions and established residence patterns.

The court treated domicile in 'England and Wales' as a single jurisdictional basis for divorce proceedings, rather than treating England and Wales as separate territories. The phrase 'English divorce proceedings' in the context of domicile in 'England and Wales' confirms this represents a unified legal jurisdiction.

	"reasoning": "Section 14A(1) of the Children Act 1989 expressly defines a special guardianship order as an order that appoints one or more individuals to be a child’s special guardian. The statutory scheme shows that the appointment is a judicial act conferring a defined legal status, not merely a description of care arrangements. The effect of such appointment is set out in section 14C, namely that the special guardian acquires parental responsibility and may exercise it to the exclusion of others (subject to limited exceptions). The cited case-law paragraph reflects the understanding that guardianship-type orders operate by formally appointing an individual to promote the child’s welfare, reinforcing that the phrase denotes a legal designation created by court order, rather than a factual caregiving role.",

Paragraph 9 of the Family Justice Council guidance lists 'age' alongside maturity and understanding as primary considerations in balancing the benefits and risks of a child giving evidence. This judicial interpretation aligns with section 1(3)(a) of the Children Act 1989, which instructs courts to consider a child's wishes and feelings 'in the light of his age and understanding'. Therefore, 'age' is not solely a numeric value but is used as a measure of developmental capacity relevant to legal assessments of welfare and competence.",

The case-law paragraph shows that an application involves an active step taken to engage the court’s powers and may carry practical and welfare consequences, particularly where pressure is exerted on a child to apply.

The reference to 'the High Court' in the context of Practice Direction 12J demonstrates that the High Court exercises family jurisdiction through its Family Division. The paragraph shows that this division has procedural requirements and specific duties when dealing with cases involving allegations or evidence of domestic abuse affecting children or parties.

The court identifies that while there is no explicit statutory provision requiring legal adviser involvement, the Family Procedure Rules implicitly require consultation and presence of the Legal Adviser before lay justices can make decisions. This interpretation demonstrates that the Family Procedure Rules establish mandatory procedural requirements that govern court operations, particularly the decision-making process involving lay justices and their interaction with legal advisers. The court treats these rules as having binding effect on court procedures, showing that Family Procedure Rules constitute comprehensive procedural governance for family court proceedings." ,

	"reasoning": "Judicial authority treats harm as a broad welfare concept extending beyond physical injury to include emotional and psychological damage, such as distress caused by separation, alienation, instability, or exposure to domestic abuse. Courts assess harm by examining the type of risk, its likelihood, and its likely consequences, and recognise that harm may arise directly or indirectly, including through impaired parenting capacity or the erosion of important relationships. The case law confirms that both past harm and the risk of future harm are relevant, that emotional abuse can constitute significant harm, and that exposure to abusive behaviour—even without direct violence to the child—may be harmful. These interpretations align with the Children Act 1989 welfare framework and inform the definition without requiring proof of actual injury in every case.",

	"reasoning": "The statutory provisions treat a custody order as a determinative order affecting substantive rights of custody, since courts are prohibited from making, varying, revoking or enforcing such orders in specified Convention contexts. Case law consistently distinguishes rights of custody from rights of access, emphasising that custody involves decisive authority over the child’s care and residence, including relocation and control over day-to-day living arrangements. Judicial discussion of wrongful removal and acquiescence proceeds on the basis that a custody order confers enforceable custodial authority, breach of which engages the Convention regime, whereas access-only arrangements do not. The definition therefore reflects the judicial understanding of custody orders as conferring core custodial decision-making powers, aligned with but not limited to the statutory language.",

	"reasoning": "The case law demonstrates that consent must be specific to the particular circumstances of the act. The judgment identifies two key elements: (a) the specific circumstances in which an act occurs, and (b) whether there was consent to those particular circumstances. The court's finding that the father did not remove the condom 'without her consent' indicates that consent was evaluated in relation to the specific act and circumstances involved. This suggests that 'does not consent' requires examining whether agreement was given to the particular act in the specific manner it was performed, rather than just general agreement to the broader activity.",

	"reasoning": "The judicial interpretation establishes that abusive behaviour is primarily characterised by patterns rather than isolated incidents. The court emphasises that 'a pattern of coercive and/or controlling behaviour can be as abusive as or more abusive than any particular factual incident', indicating that the cumulative effect of ongoing conduct is central to the definition. The interpretation extends this pattern-based approach beyond coercive and controlling behaviour to 'all forms of abuse including physical and sexual violence', showing that the definition encompasses various types of harmful conduct when they form part of a systematic pattern. The court's guidance that pattern determination should be the 'primary issue' demonstrates that abusive behaviour is fundamentally assessed through the lens of ongoing conduct rather than discrete events, unless individual incidents are exceptionally serious.",

	"definition" : "'Controlling or coercive behaviour' means a course of conduct which, when taken as a whole, exerts domination, regulation or undue pressure over another person, including by restricting their autonomy, influencing their choices, or manipulating their emotional responses, and which is to be assessed as a pattern of behaviour rather than by reference to isolated incidents." ,
	"reasoning" : "The case-law paragraphs emphasise that the behaviour must be considered as a pattern, not as discrete events, and that the court’s task is to identify sustained conduct amounting to coercion or control rather than relying on single incidents. They also indicate that such behaviour includes emotional pressure that inhibits the victim’s ability to act or speak freely, and that its evaluation should avoid rigid criminal-law formulations and instead focus on its practical effect on autonomy and wellbeing. These judicial elements support a definition centred on cumulative, autonomy-eroding conduct.",

	"reasoning" : "The case-law paragraph focuses on whether the condom was removed with the mother’s knowledge and agreement, showing that consent involves a voluntary and informed choice regarding acts, decisions, or circumstances during sexual activity. The judge resolved conflicting claims of consent, indicating that `not to have consented' is legally interpreted as the absence of informed and voluntary agreement.

	"reasoning": "The statutory text defines the institutional scope of “family proceedings” by reference to the family court, the Family Division, and associated appellate proceedings. The case-law paragraph clarifies how such proceedings operate: the family court applies a broad, holistic evidential approach, considering the ‘wide canvas’ of evidence, assessing material collectively rather than in isolated compartments, and weighing social, emotional and ethical factors. This judicial interpretation indicates that ‘family proceedings’ are characterised not only by the forum in which they take place but also by the evaluative methodology applied within them. The definition therefore integrates the statutory forum-based meaning with the judicial emphasis on holistic evidential assessment." ,

	"key_phrase": "wrongful removal",
	"definition": "Wrongful removal means the act of taking a child from their state of habitual residence in violation of the lawful rights of custody of a parent or other person legally entitled to custody, without the clear, unequivocal, and communicated consent of that parent or person, or in breach of a court order or an otherwise binding agreement concerning the child's care, residence, or travel. It encompasses both the initial removal and any subsequent retention of the child outside their habitual residence where such retention is contrary to custody rights and not agreed to or acquiesced in by the parent with custody rights. Consent to removal must be objectively verifiable, real, and operative at the time of the removal; consent given in advance may be valid only if it remains effective when the removal occurs. Withdrawal of consent is effective only if communicated and known to the removing parent. Acquiescence or conduct by the custodial parent which leads the removing parent to reasonably believe that the removal is permitted negates the wrongful character of the removal. The concept is to be applied in the context of family life and the disintegration of family units, rather than strict contractual principles, and with due regard to the underlying purpose of child protection and the swift restoration of the child to their habitual residence, as reflected in domestic law and international instruments such as the Hague Convention.",
	"reasoning": "The judicial interpretation across the provided case-law emphasizes multiple interrelated principles. Wrongful removal is distinguished from wrongful retention: removal occurs when a child is taken from their habitual residence without lawful authority or consent, whereas wrongful retention refers to failure to return a child after lawful temporary removal. Consent must be clear, unequivocal, communicated to the removing parent, and operative at the time of removal. Conduct or acquiescence by the custodial parent may prevent a removal from being wrongful, but only where the conduct is sufficiently unequivocal to lead the removing parent to reasonably rely upon consent. Courts assess consent in the context of the realities of family life, not contractual law, taking into account words, actions, and broader circumstances. The purpose of the wrongful removal concept is aligned with both domestic legislation and the Hague Convention, which prioritizes the prompt return of children to their habitual residence to prevent harm. The removal must be measured objectively, considering whether the child’s removal or retention contravenes custody rights, disregarding internal states of mind, and ensuring protection of the child from the adverse effects of unlawful removal or retention.",

	"definition": "Child's welfare means the overall well-being of a child, encompassing physical, emotional, educational, and developmental needs, as well as the impact of familial and social circumstances. In any decision or proceedings affecting a child, the child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration, including regard to the child's wishes and feelings (in light of age and understanding), the likely effect of any change in circumstances, risk of harm, parental capability, and any other factors relevant to promoting and safeguarding the child's interests.",
	"reasoning": "The case-law paragraphs consistently emphasize that 'child's welfare' is the paramount consideration in all decisions affecting children. The welfare principle requires a holistic assessment, considering physical, emotional, educational needs, and potential harm. The judicial interpretation extends to the child's wishes and feelings, their family relationships, and social context. Courts must weigh competing factors through a welfare analysis, considering short-term and long-term interests, and applying statutory presumptions such as parental involvement furthering the child's welfare unless evidence suggests otherwise. Legislation, particularly sections 1 and 64 of the Children Act 1989, provides a framework for assessing welfare but the case law clarifies that the principle encompasses a comprehensive and flexible evaluation focused on promoting and safeguarding the child's best interests in all relevant circumstances.",

In any decision by a court, adoption agency, or relevant authority affecting the child, the child's welfare is the paramount consideration throughout the child’s minority and into adulthood.",
	"reasoning": "The case law consistently emphasizes that the child's welfare encompasses both present and future well-being, extending to physical, emotional, educational, psychological, social, and relational aspects. It is synonymous with the child's best interests and well-being, requiring courts to take a medium- and long-term perspective rather than focusing solely on short-term issues. Judicial interpretation highlights that welfare is holistic and includes the child’s wishes and feelings, their family and other significant relationships, cultural and religious background, and protection from harm. Decisions must be made in the context of competing interests and rights of parents or others involved, balancing these factors with the child's welfare as paramount. Statutory provisions reinforce this approach, mandating that courts or adoption agencies must regard the child's welfare as the paramount consideration when making adoption decisions. The concept is forward-looking and life-long, covering both immediate and long-term impacts on the child’s development and identity.",

	"key_phrase": "paramount consideration",
	"definition": "“Paramount consideration” refers to the strict legal requirement that, whenever a court or authorised decision-maker exercises a function to which the welfare principle applies, the child’s welfare must not merely be one factor among many but must instead occupy an overriding and pre-eminent position in the evaluative process. It means that the child’s welfare is treated as the determinative element: it has priority over all other interests, rights, or policy concerns that may be engaged in the proceedings. In practice, this requires the decision-maker to assess the child’s physical, emotional, psychological, developmental, educational, relational, cultural and long-term needs in a holistic manner, and then to ensure that no other consideration—whether relating to parental claims, procedural preferences, or broader societal interests—can lawfully displace the outcome indicated by that welfare assessment. The concept encompasses both a substantive duty (to give greatest weight to what best promotes the child’s well-being) and a structural duty (to organise the decision-making process so that the child’s welfare governs the ultimate conclusion).",
	"reasoning": "The reasoning is founded on a consistent interpretation across legislation and case law that treats the child’s welfare as the decisive and controlling factor wherever the statutory welfare principle applies. Judicial explanations repeatedly emphasise that when the law requires welfare to be the paramount consideration, the court must allow it to override all countervailing claims or interests, even when those claims are grounded in important rights or legitimate parental expectations. The descriptions of the welfare assessment in these authorities show that it is necessarily broad, case-specific and forward-looking, capturing the full range of the child’s physical, emotional and developmental needs. They also illustrate that being ‘paramount’ imposes a qualitative distinction: welfare is not simply weighed alongside other considerations but governs the outcome. In contrast, where welfare is described as merely ‘important’ or ‘relevant’ in other contexts, this distinction reinforces that paramountcy imposes a uniquely stringent obligation. Accordingly, the definition must reflect the overriding, determinative and hierarchically superior role that the child’s welfare plays whenever a statutory welfare provision designates it as the paramount consideration.",

	"definition": "“Paramount consideration” means that, in the exercise of any function to which section 1(1) of the Children Act 1989 applies, the child’s welfare must be treated as the overriding and determinative factor, taking precedence over all other rights, interests or considerations. It requires the court to undertake a holistic and comparative evaluation of all available options by reference to the welfare checklist, ensuring that no competing claim—whether parental, procedural or Convention-based—can displace the outcome indicated by the child’s best interests.",
	"reasoning": "Step-by-step, the paragraphs consistently affirm that where section 1(1) applies, the child’s welfare is not merely important but the controlling factor. Several judgments expressly describe it as the sole or authentic governing principle. The paragraphs repeatedly link paramountcy to: (1) an obligation to apply the statutory welfare checklist; (2) the need for a holistic, comparative welfare analysis; and (3) the requirement that the child’s welfare prevail even where parental autonomy, competing rights (including Article 8), or strong parental motives point in a different direction. The case law also distinguishes contexts in which welfare is only a “primary” consideration (for example, Hague Convention or reporting-restriction cases) from those governed by section 1(1), underscoring that paramountcy is a uniquely stringent obligation. Other passages emphasise that paramountcy authorises the court, if necessary, to override sincerely held parental views, to balance proportionality considerations by reference to the child’s rights first, and to determine only those facts necessary to ascertain the child’s best interests. Across the authorities, the common thread is that paramountcy establishes a hierarchy in which the child’s welfare determines the outcome and governs the structure of the evaluative process, requiring all proposals to be assessed comparatively and by reference to their impact on the child.",

	"key_phrase": "inherent jurisdiction with respect to children",
	"definition": "“Inherent jurisdiction with respect to children” means the residual protective authority of the High Court, exercisable as a measure of last resort to safeguard a child’s welfare, which permits the court to make any order necessary for the child’s protection unless prohibited by statute, but which must not be used to circumvent or conflict with an existing statutory scheme and may only supplement that scheme where no statutory route can achieve the required protective outcome.",
	"reasoning": "The case law consistently frames the inherent jurisdiction as a residual, protective power derived from the Crown’s parens patriae authority. It is described as an ultimate safety net, available only when no statutory mechanism can meet the child’s welfare needs. Multiple paragraphs emphasise that the jurisdiction cannot be used in a manner that cuts across or contradicts legislative schemes—mirroring the prohibitions in s.100(2) CA 1989, which restrict its use where doing so would compel local authority accommodation or otherwise bypass statutory requirements. Courts repeatedly state that inherent jurisdiction must not authorise actions that the statutory framework forbids, such as using wardship to require accommodation, or approving placements that would render unlawful a refusal to comply with regulatory requirements. Conversely, where the statutory scheme does not apply or cannot operate—such as when a child is not “looked after”, no statutory order is available, or immediate protective action is required—the jurisdiction may be invoked to fill statutory gaps, typically for short, tightly controlled periods. The protective purpose is anchored in welfare, but the court’s powers are constrained by statutory limits and by the principle that the inherent jurisdiction is exceptional, supplementary and never a vehicle for avoiding statutory safeguards. These judicial principles align with the legislative purpose of s.100, which tightly regulates when inherent jurisdiction may be used in relation to children.",

	"key_phrase": "rights of custody",
	"definition": "'Rights of custody' are the legal entitlements of a parent or guardian to have actual care, control, and decision-making authority over a child, including determining the child's habitual residence, preventing the child from being removed from a jurisdiction without the consent of the holder of those rights or a court order, and enforcing compliance with custody arrangements. These rights are distinct from mere rights of access or visitation, and do not include potential or contingent rights that require the holder to seek court approval to exercise them. Rights of custody encompass both statutory and court-recognized powers to make, vary, or revoke custody-related orders, and are interpreted autonomously under international instruments such as the 1980 Hague Convention to focus on the practical exercise of parental authority over the child’s care and residence.",
	"reasoning": "The case law and legislation collectively clarify that 'rights of custody' are not synonymous with mere 'rights of access' or rights to seek future court intervention. Re D [2006] UKHL 51 emphasized that extensive access rights do not constitute rights of custody, and Re D [2024] 991 reinforced that a parent’s potential right of veto or the ability to apply to court for a future order does not create custody rights. Cases such as Re P [2004] EWCA Civ 971 and Re D [2004] EWCA Civ 971 demonstrate that a court order imposing a 'ne exeat' condition or equivalent parental veto confers actual rights of custody because it restricts unilateral removal of the child. Consent or acquiescence by the wronged parent (Re P-J [2009] EWCA Civ 588; Re IG [2023] EWHC 2162) affects the exercise of custody rights but does not itself create them. Judicial interpretation under the 1980 Hague Convention treats the term as autonomous (Hunter v Murrow [2005] 2 FLR 1119; Re D [2024] 991), requiring courts to distinguish between the rights a parent holds under domestic law of the requesting state and whether those rights constitute rights of custody for Convention purposes. Rights of custody involve actual authority over the child's residence and care, enforcement of custody arrangements, and the capacity to prevent wrongful removal, aligning with domestic statutes such as the Children Act 1989, Family Law Act 1986, and relevant sections of the 1985 Act. Cases such as Re D [2006] and Re H [2000] confirm that courts evaluate these rights by their substantive effect on the child rather than their formal or potential nature. Thus, the definition integrates both domestic legislative provisions and the autonomous, practical interpretation applied by the courts.",

	"key_phrase": "family proceedings",
	"definition": "Family proceedings means any proceedings under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to children, or under the enactments specified in section 8(4) of the Children Act 1989, which involve the determination or management of issues concerning the welfare, upbringing, or parental responsibilities of a child, including the making of child arrangements orders, specific issue orders, or prohibited steps orders.",
	"reasoning": "The statutory text of section 8(3) of the Children Act 1989 defines 'family proceedings' as proceedings under the High Court's inherent jurisdiction or under specified enactments, excluding applications for leave under section 100(3). The case law demonstrates how courts interpret this term in practice: K v K [2022] EWCA Civ 468 and Re H-N [2021] EWCA Civ 448 show that family proceedings encompass judicial processes that determine the welfare of children, including fact-finding hearings and Dispute Resolution Appointments. Paragraph 40 of K v K clarifies that such hearings are not free-standing litigation but are part of proceedings addressing the child's welfare or protection. Paragraph 32 emphasizes that courts must identify relevant welfare issues and only resolve factual disputes necessary for child arrangements. Paragraph 43 further confirms that proceedings involve the determination of parental rights, engaging Art 6 and Art 8 ECHR protections. Therefore, the judicial interpretation emphasizes that 'family proceedings' are proceedings specifically focused on the welfare of children and the resolution of disputes concerning parental responsibilities, consistent with the statutory framework.",

	"key_phrase": "all the circumstances of the case",
	"definition": "'All the circumstances of the case' means the totality of relevant matters that the court must consider in exercising its discretion, including: (a) the factual matrix upon which the application is based; (b) the connections between the subject matter and any relevant jurisdictions; (c) the nature and characteristics of the proceedings in question; (d) applicable legal principles, including those relating to judicial comity where relevant; (e) the manner and context in which proceedings have been brought or conducted; (f) the balance of prejudice or detriment to the parties according to whether relief is granted or refused; and (g) any other matters material to the fair and just determination of the application.",
	"reasoning": "The statutory phrase 'all the circumstances of the case' appears in section 31(2)(c) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 as part of the test for determining whether it would be just and convenient to grant a declaration or injunction in judicial review proceedings. The case law paragraph, though relating to anti-suit injunctions rather than judicial review directly, provides detailed judicial interpretation of what 'all the circumstances' encompasses when a court exercises discretion. The court identifies that this phrase requires consideration of: (1) the underlying facts; (2) jurisdictional connections; (3) the nature of substantive proceedings; (4) legal principles including comity; (5) the context in which proceedings are brought; (6) the balance of prejudice to parties; and (7) any other relevant matters. This multi-factorial approach demonstrates that 'all the circumstances' is not limited to the immediate facts but extends to systemic and procedural considerations, comparative impacts on parties, and broader legal principles. The interpretation confirms that this phrase operates as a broad discretionary gateway requiring holistic assessment. When applied to section 31(2), this means the court must consider not only matters in paragraphs (a) and (b) but a comprehensive range of factors to determine whether granting relief would be just and convenient. The definition synthesizes these interpretive principles into a legislative formulation applicable across contexts where this standard phrase appears.",

	"reasoning": "Section 25(1) requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, prioritizing the welfare of minor children. Sections 25(2)-(4) provide a detailed checklist of financial, personal, and familial factors to guide the court. Case law (paragraphs 26, 34, 40, 46) confirms that the court must consider all relevant factors in a balanced, gender-neutral manner, not focusing solely on one aspect such as needs or financial provision, and that practical implications and the totality of circumstances are critical in reaching a fair and proportionate decision.",
